# PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS


## GENERAL

Microsoft is a technology company committed to making digital technology and artificial intelligence ("Al") available broadly and doing so responsibly. Our
mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.

We develop and support a broad portfolio of technology solutions for individuals and businesses, focusing on secure, trusted, and innovative platforms
and tools that meet evolving customer needs across cloud computing, productivity and collaboration, and personal computing. We strive to create
opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world.

AI is fundamentally transforming productivity for every individual, organization, and industry. Microsoft's AI offerings span every layer of the technology
stack, enabling transformative outcomes across sectors and unlocking opportunity for every country, community, and individual.

We believe Al should be as empowering as it is powerful, and we're committed to designing and deploying Al responsibly with safety and security from
the outset.


### What We Offer

Founded in 1975, we develop and support software, services, devices, and solutions that deliver new value for customers and help people and
businesses realize their full potential.

We offer an array of services, including cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content, and we provide
solution support and consulting services. We also deliver relevant online advertising to a global audience.

Our products include operating systems, cross-device productivity and collaboration applications, server applications, business solution applications,
desktop and server management tools, software development tools, and video games. We also design and sell devices, including PCs, tablets, gaming
and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.

Digital transformation and adoption of AI continues to revolutionize more business workstreams for organizations in every sector across the globe. For
enterprises, digital technology empowers employees, optimizes operations, engages customers, and in some cases, changes the very core of products
and services.

<!-- PageBreak -->


# PART I

<!-- PageNumber="Item 1" -->

The Microsoft Cloud provides integration across the technology stack while offering openness, improving time to value, reducing costs, and increasing
agility. Our cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit
than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of
computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs.

We prioritize security above all else and we offer our customers integrated AI-driven products addressing security, compliance, identity, management,
and privacy across customers' multi-cloud, application, and device assets.


## The Ambitions That Drive Us

To achieve our vision, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions:

· Reinvent productivity and business processes to help organizations and individuals work and collaborate more securely and efficiently.

·Build the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge platform to provide a foundation for our customers' digital workloads including hybrid consistency,
developer productivity, data and AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance.

· Create more personal computing to enable users to interact with technology in more intuitive, engaging, and dynamic ways.


## Our Future Opportunity

We are focused on helping customers use the breadth and depth of the Microsoft Cloud to get the most value out of their digital spend while leading the
AI platform wave across our solution areas. We continue to develop complete, intelligent solutions for our customers that empower people to be
productive and collaborate, while safeguarding businesses and simplifying IT management. Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas of
technology over the long term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in:

·Transforming the workplace to deliver new, modern, modular business applications, drive deeper insights, and improve how people
communicate, collaborate, learn, work, and interact with one another.

·Building and running cloud-based services in ways that utilize ubiquitous computing to unleash new experiences and opportunities for
businesses and individuals.

·Applying Al and ambient intelligence to drive insights, revolutionize many types of work and business processes, and provide substantive
productivity gains using Microsoft 365 Copilot and agents.

·Providing training on generative Al and greater access to digital learning and resources through skilling programs and initiatives, grants, and
LinkedIn learning pathways.

·Inventing new gaming experiences that bring people together around their shared love for games on any device and pushing the boundaries of
innovation with console and PC gaming.

·Leveraging Windows to fuel our cloud business, grow our share of the PC market, and drive increased engagement with our services like
Microsoft Edge, Bing, Copilot, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 Consumer, Xbox Game Pass, and more.

· Tackling security from all angles with our integrated, end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance, identity, and management, across all
clouds and platforms.

Our future growth depends on our ability to transcend current product category definitions, business models, and sales motions.


### Commitment to Sustainability

Microsoft is committed to sustainability and our approach to addressing climate change starts with the sustainability of our own business. In 2020, we
announced goals to become a carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste company by 2030. Since announcing these goals, we have made
meaningful progress while having seen major changes in both the technology sector and in our understanding of what it will take to meet our goals.
Progress toward these goals can be found in our annual Environmental Sustainability Report.

# PART I Item 1


# OPERATING SEGMENTS

We operate our business and report our financial performance using three segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More
Personal Computing. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the
alignment of strategies and objectives across the development, sales, marketing, and services organizations, and they provide a framework for timely and
rational allocation of resources within businesses.

In August 2024, we announced changes to the composition of our segments. These changes align our segments with how we currently manage our
business, most notably bringing the commercial components of Microsoft 365 together in the Productivity and Business Processes segment. Beginning in
fiscal year 2025, the information that our chief operating decision maker is regularly provided and reviews for purposes of allocating resources and
assessing performance reflects these segment changes.

Additional information on our operating segments and geographic and product information is contained in Note 18 - Segment Information and
Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).

Our reportable segments are described below.


## Productivity and Business Processes

Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information
services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises:

·Microsoft 365 Commercial products and cloud services, including Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud, comprising Microsoft 365 Commercial,
Enterprise Mobility + Security, the cloud portion of Windows Commercial, the per-user portion of Power BI, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft
Teams, Microsoft 365 Security and Compliance, and Microsoft 365 Copilot; and Microsoft 365 Commercial products, comprising Windows
Commercial on-premises and Office licensed on-premises.

·Microsoft 365 Consumer products and cloud services, including Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions, Office licensed on-premises, and other
consumer services.

·LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions.

· Dynamics products and cloud services, including Dynamics 365, comprising a set of intelligent, cloud-based applications across ERP, CRM,
Power Apps, and Power Automate; and on-premises ERP and CRM applications.


## Microsoft 365 Commercial Products and Cloud Services

Microsoft 365 Commercial is an AI-powered business and productivity solutions platform that brings together Office, Windows, Microsoft 365 Copilot, and
Enterprise Mobility + Security to help organizations empower their employees. Growth depends on our ability to reach new users in new markets such as
frontline workers, small and medium businesses, and growth markets, as well as add AI-enabled tools, features, and agentic scenarios to our core
product and service offerings across communication, collaboration, analytics, security, compliance, and other AI business productivity categories.
Microsoft 365 Commercial revenue is mainly affected by a combination of continued installed base growth and average revenue per user expansion, as
well as the continued shift from Office licensed on-premises to Microsoft 365.


## Microsoft 365 Consumer Products and Cloud Services

Microsoft 365 Consumer is designed to increase personal productivity and creativity through a range of products and services. Growth depends on our
ability to reach new users, add value to our core product set with new features including AI tools, and continue to expand our product and service
offerings into new markets. Microsoft 365 Consumer cloud revenue and Office Consumer products revenue is mainly affected by the percentage of
customers that buy Office with their new devices and the continued shift from Office licensed on-premises to Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions.
Microsoft 365 Consumer cloud revenue is also affected by the demand for communication and storage through Outlook.com and OneDrive, which is
largely driven by subscriptions and advertising.

<!-- PageHeader="PART I" -->
<!-- PageNumber="Item 1" -->


## Linkedin

LinkedIn connects the world's professionals to make them more productive and successful and transforms the way companies hire, market, sell, and
learn. In addition to LinkedIn's free services, Linkedln offers monetized solutions designed to offer Al-enabled insights and productivity: Talent Solutions,
Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions. Growth will depend on our ability to increase LinkedIn member engagement on the
platform and our ability to continue offering insight and AI-enabled services that provide value for our members and customers. LinkedIn revenue is
mainly affected by demand from enterprises and professionals for subscriptions to Talent Solutions, Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions
offerings, as well as member engagement and the quality of the sponsored content delivered to those members to drive Marketing Solutions.


## Dynamics Products and Cloud Services

Dynamics provides cloud-based and on-premises business solutions for financial management, enterprise resource planning ("ERP"), customer
relationship management ("CRM"), and supply chain management, as well as agentic Al and other low code application development platforms, for small
and medium businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Dynamics revenue is driven by the number of users licensed and
applications consumed, expansion of average revenue per user, and the continued shift to Dynamics 365, a unified set of cloud-based intelligent
business applications, including our low code development platforms, such as Power Apps and Power Automate.


### Competition

Competitors to Office include software and global application vendors, web-based and mobile application companies, AI-first application companies, as
well as local application developers. We compete by providing secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productivity and collaboration tools
and services that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already have both on-premises or in the cloud.

Windows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint competes with
endpoint security solution providers.

Our Enterprise Mobility + Security offerings compete with products from a range of competitors including identity vendors, security solution vendors, and
numerous other security point solution vendors.

LinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks; recruiting, talent management, and human resource services companies; job boards;
companies that provide learning and development products and services; online and offline outlets that generate revenue from advertisers and
marketers; and online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.

Dynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution providers.


## Intelligent Cloud

Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that power modern business and developers.
This segment primarily comprises:

.Server products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services, comprising cloud and Al consumption-based services, GitHub
cloud services, Nuance Healthcare cloud services, virtual desktop offerings, and other cloud services; and Server products, comprising SQL
Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, related Client Access Licenses ("CALs"), and other on-premises offerings.

·Enterprise and partner services, including Enterprise Support Services, Industry Solutions, Nuance professional services, Microsoft Partner
Network, and Learning Experience.

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="PART I" -->
<!-- PageNumber="Item 1" -->


## Server Products and Cloud Services

Azure is a comprehensive set of cloud services that offer developers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, deploy, and manage
applications on any platform or device. Customers can use Azure through our global network of datacenters for computing, networking, storage, mobile
and web application services, AI, Internet of Things, cognitive services, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to devote more resources to
development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure revenue is mainly
affected by infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service consumption-based services.

Azure AI offerings provide a competitive advantage as companies seek ways to optimize and scale their business with AI. We offer supercomputing
power for AI at scale to run large workloads, complemented by our rapidly expanding portfolio of AI cloud services (including the latest models) and
hardware, which includes custom-built silicon and strong partnerships with chip manufacturers. Azure AI Foundry is a unified platform for developers to
design, customize, and manage AI applications and agents.

Our server products are designed to make IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and efficient. Server software is integrated
server infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Server operating system. This includes the server
platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, virtualization, service-oriented architecture platform, security, and
identity software. We also license standalone and software development lifecycle tools for software architects, developers, testers, and project managers.
Server products revenue is mainly affected by purchases through volume licensing programs, licenses sold to OEMs, and retail packaged products. CALs
provide access rights to certain server products, including SQL Server and Windows Server, and revenue is reported along with the associated server
product.

GitHub and Nuance Healthcare include both cloud and on-premises offerings. GitHub provides a collaboration platform for developers to manage code
and incorporate AI and agent-based tools across the software development lifecycle. Nuance Healthcare provides AI solutions to the healthcare industry.


## Enterprise and Partner Services

Enterprise and partner services, including Enterprise Support Services, Industry Solutions, Nuance professional services, Microsoft Partner Network, and
Learning Experience, assist customers in developing, deploying, and managing Microsoft server solutions, Microsoft desktop solutions, and Nuance
conversational AI and ambient intelligent solutions, along with providing training and certification to developers and IT professionals on various Microsoft
products.


### Competition

Azure faces diverse competition from cloud service providers and open source offerings. Azure's competitive advantage includes enabling a hybrid cloud,
allowing deployment of existing datacenters with our public cloud into a single, cohesive infrastructure, and the ability to run at a scale that meets the
needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities. Our AI offerings compete with AI products from hyperscalers, as well as products from other emerging
competitors and other open source offerings, many of which are also current or potential partners. Our Azure Security offerings include our cloud security
solution and security information and event management solution, which compete with providers in the cybersecurity and cloud security space. We
believe our cloud's global scale, coupled with our broad portfolio of identity and security solutions, allows us to effectively solve complex cybersecurity
challenges for our customers and differentiates us from the competition.

Our server products face competition from a wide variety of server operating systems and applications offered by companies with a range of market
approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers offer their own versions of the Unix operating system preinstalled on server hardware and
nearly all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the Linux operating system.

We compete to provide enterprise-wide computing and point solutions with numerous commercial software vendors that offer solutions and middleware
technology platforms, software applications for connectivity, security, hosting, database, and e-business servers.

<!-- PageBreak -->


# PART I

<!-- PageNumber="Item 1" -->

Our database, business intelligence, and data warehousing solutions offerings compete with products from providers in the data and analytics industry.
Our system management solutions compete with server management and server virtualization platform providers. Our products for software developers
compete against offerings from major technology providers, as well as open source alternatives.

We believe our server products provide customers with advantages in performance, total costs of ownership, and productivity by delivering superior
applications, development tools, compatibility with a broad base of hardware and software applications, security, and manageability.

Our Enterprise and partner services business competes with a wide range of companies that provide strategy and business planning, application
development, and infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small niche businesses focused on specific technologies.


## More Personal Computing

Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the experience with our technology. This
segment primarily comprises:

·Windows and Devices, including Windows OEM licensing (Windows Pro and non-Pro licenses sold through the OEM channel) and Devices,
comprising Surface and PC accessories.

.Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first- and third-party content (including games and in-game
content), Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming, advertising, and other cloud services.

.Search and news advertising, comprising Bing and Copilot, Microsoft News, Microsoft Edge, and third-party affiliates.


### Windows and Devices

The Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling consistency of experience,
applications, and information across their devices. Windows OEM revenue is impacted significantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses
purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the devices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows OEM revenue is impacted
by:

. The mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size.

· Differences in device market demand between developed markets and growth markets.

·Growth of the Al PC category.

·Attachment of Windows to devices shipped.

.Customer mix between consumer, small and medium businesses, and large enterprises.

·Changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel.

·Pricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts from local and regional system
builders to large multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows versions licensed.

·Constraints in the supply chain of device components.

·Piracy.

We design and sell devices, such as Surface (including Copilot+ PCs) and PC accessories. Our devices are designed to enable people and organizations
to connect to the people and content that matter most using Windows and integrated Microsoft products and services. Surface is designed to help
organizations, students, and consumers be more productive. Growth in Devices is dependent on total PC shipments, the ability to attract new customers,
our product roadmap, and expanding into new categories.

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="PART I" -->
<!-- PageNumber="Item 1" -->


### Gaming

Microsoft is expanding how billions of people globally access and play video games on PC, console, mobile, and cloud. Our game content is developed
through a collection of first-party studios creating iconic and differentiated gaming experiences. We continue to invest in gaming studios and content to
expand our intellectual property roadmap and leverage new content creators. These unique gaming experiences are the cornerstone of Xbox Game
Pass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to a curated library of first- and third-party titles.

The gamer remains at the heart of the Xbox ecosystem. We are identifying new opportunities to attract gamers across a variety of different end points
through our first- and third-party content and business diversification across subscriptions, ads, and digital stores. We've seen new devices from third-
party manufacturers along with key PC and mobile end points that help us empower gamers to play in a way that is most convenient to them. We are
focused on growing the platform and expanding to new ecosystems to engage as many gamers as possible.

Xbox enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences that are accessible on Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices, and other
devices. Xbox is designed to benefit users by providing access to a network of certified applications and services and to benefit our developer and partner
ecosystems by providing access to a large customer base. Xbox revenue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales of first- and third-party content, as
well as advertising. Growth of our Gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through Xbox enabled content, availability of games,
providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the devices used to access our content and services, and
the ability to create new experiences.


### Search and News Advertising

Our Search and news advertising business is designed to deliver relevant search, native, and display advertising to a global audience. Microsoft Copilot
is a digital companion designed to inform, entertain, and inspire. Our Microsoft Edge browser and Bing search engine with Copilot are key tools to enable
user acquisition and engagement, while our technology platform enables accelerated delivery of digital advertising solutions. In addition to first-party tools,
we have several partnerships with companies through which we provide and monetize search offerings. Growth depends on our ability to attract new
users, understand intent, and match intent with relevant content on advertising offerings.


#### Competition

Windows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices. We believe Windows competes effectively by
giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-use interface, and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications,
including those that enable productivity.

Devices face competition from various computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination of high-quality industrial design
and innovative technologies across various price points. Many of these manufacturers are also current or potential partners and customers, including our
Windows OEMs.

Xbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming services. We also compete with other
providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with other console platforms. We believe our
gaming platform is effectively positioned against, and uniquely differentiated from, competitive products and services based on significant innovation in
hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong content from our own first-party
game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.

Our Search and news advertising business competes with search engines, and a wide array of websites, social platforms, and portals that provide
content and online offerings to end users.


# HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES

We design our programs to attract, reward, and retain top talent while fostering continuous employee development and reinforcing our organizational
culture and values. Our total compensation offering is both highly differentiated and competitive within the market, and we also monitor pay equity across
multiple dimensions. We have invested significantly in employee wellbeing and offer a differentiated benefits package which includes many physical,
emotional, and financial wellness programs. We also provide access to continuous learning through a wide range of internal and external content,
supporting professional growth across roles and disciplines. Through our employee listening systems, we gather direct feedback from our workforce,
enabling us to adapt our programs and address employee needs globally with real-time insights. Additionally, our culture prioritizes the security of both
our customers and Microsoft, embedding this responsibility across all teams and functions.


# OPERATIONS

We have regional operations service centers in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East that support our business operations, including
customer contract and order processing, billing, credit and collections, customer lifecycle AI and cloud operations, and vendor management and logistics.

In addition to our operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout each of these regions. We continue to align our datacenter locations and
server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the
availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units ("GPUs") and other
components.

We engage third-party manufacturers to produce our devices and have implemented measures to enhance supply chain efficiency and resilience,
including the ability to relocate production geographically.

There are few qualified suppliers for certain components of our servers and devices. Extended or unforeseen disruptions at these suppliers could impact
our ability to operate our datacenters and manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.


# RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT


## Product and Service Development

Our success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, initiate and embrace disruptive
technology trends, enter new geographic and product markets, and drive broad adoption of our products and services. We make significant investments
in research and development for new and existing products, services, and technologies, including tools and platforms spanning digital work and life
experiences, cloud computing, AI, devices, security, and operating systems.

We develop most of our products and services internally which allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and
closer technical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important
and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that
may affect software and hardware design. Before releasing new software platforms, and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms, we
provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing.

We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of product research and development activities, and as appropriate, we will
coordinate our research and development across operating segments and leverage the results across the company. This includes continuing to support
fundamental research, which provides us with a unique perspective on future trends and contributes to our innovation.

## Intellectual Property

We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to ensure the enforcement of
copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products, services, business plans, and
branding. While we employ much of our internally-developed intellectual property in our products and services, we also engage in outbound licensing of
specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees' products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with
other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We may also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and
services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry
standards, advancing interoperability, supporting societal and/or environmental efforts, or attracting and enabling our external development community.
Our engagement with open source software also causes us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations.

While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services, we believe, based upon past
experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and
product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third-party relating to the development of our
products.


# DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING

Our customers include individual consumers, small and medium organizations, large global enterprises, public-sector institutions, service providers,
application developers, and OEMs. We market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: direct, distributors and resellers,
and OEMs. Our sales organization performs a variety of functions, including working directly with commercial enterprises and public-sector organizations
worldwide to identify and meet their technology and digital transformation requirements; supporting system integrators, independent software vendors,
and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products and services; and
managing OEM relationships.


## Direct

Many organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts,
with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our
products and services ("Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors" or "ESA"). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and
corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.

We also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through our digital
marketplaces and online stores. Additionally, our Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and
customers across industries.


## Distributors and Resellers

Organizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners ("LSP"), distributors, value-added resellers
("VAR"), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations,
distributors resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically reach small and medium organizations. ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and operate
as resellers for our other volume licensing programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.

We distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and retail outlets.
Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of
field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.

Our Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and
specialized services.

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="PART I Item 1" -->


## OEMs

We distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the
OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices pre-installed with other Microsoft products and
services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Microsoft 365 Consumer.

There are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with them is managed through a direct
agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational
OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders
consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft
distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.


### LICENSING OPTIONS

We offer options for organizations of varying sizes that want to purchase our cloud services and on-premises software. We license these organizations
under volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services instead of having to acquire separate
licenses through retail channels. These volume licensing programs have varying programmatic requirements and benefits to best meet the needs of our
customers.

Software Assurance ("SA") conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides
support, tools, training, and other licensing benefits to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. SA is required to be purchased with certain
volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.


## Volume Licensing Programs


### Enterprise Agreement

Enterprise Agreements offer large organizations a manageable volume licensing program that gives them the flexibility to buy cloud services and
software licenses under one agreement. Enterprise Agreements are designed for medium or large organizations that want to license Microsoft products
and services organization-wide over a three-year period. Organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses (covered with SA) and/or subscribe to
cloud services.


### Microsoft Customer Agreement

Microsoft Customer Agreements are simplified purchase agreements presented, accepted, and stored through a digital experience. Microsoft Customer
Agreements are non-expiring agreements that are designed to support all customers over time, whether purchasing through a partner or directly from
Microsoft.


### Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement

Microsoft Online Subscription Agreements are designed for small and medium organizations that want to subscribe to, activate, provision, and maintain
cloud services seamlessly and directly via the web. These agreements allow customers to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud-based
services.


### Microsoft Products and Services Agreement

Microsoft Products and Services Agreements are designed for medium and large organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises
software as needed, with no organization-wide commitment, under a single, non-expiring agreement. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses or
subscribe to licenses. SA is optional for customers that purchase perpetual licenses.

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="PART I Item 1" -->


### Open Value

Open Value agreements are a simple, cost-effective way to acquire the latest Microsoft technology. These agreements are designed for small and
medium organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software over a three-year period. Under Open Value agreements,
organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses and SA is included.


### Select Plus

A Select Plus agreement is designed for government and academic organizations to acquire on-premises licenses at any affiliate or department level,
while realizing advantages as one organization. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses and SA is optional.


### Partner Programs

The Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider Program offers customers an easy way to license the cloud services they need in combination with the value-
added services offered by their systems integrator, managed services provider, or cloud reseller partner. Partners in this program can easily package
their own products and services to directly provision, manage, and support their customer subscriptions.

The Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement allows hosting service providers and independent software vendors who want to license eligible
Microsoft software products to provide hosted applications and software services to their end customers. Partners license software over a three-year
period and are billed monthly based on units licensed.

The Independent Software Vendor Royalty Program enables partners to integrate Microsoft products into other applications and then license the unified
business solution to their end users.


# GOVERNMENT REGULATION

We are subject to a wide range of laws, regulations, and legal requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those that may apply to our products and
online services offerings, and those that impose requirements related to user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and
online content. These requirements are continually evolving, and they can be unclear and vary significantly across jurisdictions. We have implemented
comprehensive compliance programs across our operations to adapt to these changes and to maintain customer and regulator confidence. We monitor
regulatory developments around the world and implement policies, controls, and technical safeguards so that our operations, products, and services
meet applicable legal standards. Our business teams, with legal support, manage the compliance programs and prepare external regulatory and
commercial reporting, and our internal audit teams conduct reviews of the programs and processes. While we have a unified approach to regulatory
compliance, some of the programs and processes are tailored to meet specific regulatory obligations, such as with the creation of independent
compliance functions required by the European Union ("EU") Digital Markets Act and the EU Digital Services Act, which oversee, monitor, and assess
the company's compliance with these acts.

For a description of the risks we face related to regulatory matters, refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K).

## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our
business, operations, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and the trading price of our common stock.


### STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS


#### We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which could adversely affect our results of operations.


##### Competition in the technology sector

Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose
narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our
businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and
frequent introductions of new products and services. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products, devices, and services that appeal to
businesses and consumers, we may not remain competitive, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.


##### Competition among platform-based ecosystems

An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A
well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate
growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to meet consumer demand and to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We
face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms.

.A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the hardware and software elements of a product and related services,
has succeeded with some consumer products such as PCs, tablets, smartphones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices.
Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications and
content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from their vertically-
integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services. Shifting a portion of our business to a
vertically-integrated model may increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins.

.We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant competition from competing platforms
developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablets. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the
perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users continue to turn to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by
PCs. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a PC, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract
application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC
operating system margins. Popular products or services offered on competing platforms could increase their competitive strength. In addition,
some of our devices compete with products made by our OEM partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform.

.Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and utility of content and
applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and
applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that
these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with competitors' content and application
marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins. Competitors' rules governing their content and applications
marketplaces may restrict our ability to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model
objectives.

For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, which could adversely affect our
business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.

<!-- PageBreak -->


# PART I Item 1A


# Business model competition

Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.

. A material part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. We and our competitors
continue to devote significant resources to developing and deploying cloud-based strategies and services for consumers and business
customers, and pricing and delivery models are evolving.

.We are investing in artificial intelligence ("Al") across the entire company and infusing generative Al capabilities into our consumer and
commercial offerings. AI technology and services are a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, and new competitors continue to enter
the market. We will bear significant development and operational costs to build and support the AI models, services, platforms, and infrastructure
necessary to meet the needs of our customers. To compete effectively we must also be responsive to technological change, new and potential
regulatory developments, and public scrutiny.

·Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business models, the license-based
proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue. We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software
products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many
of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model.

.Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services, and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising.
Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at little or no cost, competing directly with
our revenue-generating products.

.Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, developing, making
available, or using AI models that are open, and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. These firms do not bear the
full costs of research and development for the open source products. Some open source products mimic the features and functionality of our
products.

The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for
research and development, marketing, and sales incentives, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our focus on cloud-based and AI services presents execution and competitive risks. We are incurring significant costs to build and maintain
infrastructure to support cloud-based and AI services, reducing operating margins. Whether we succeed in cloud-based and AI services depends on our
execution in several areas, including:

.Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based and Al services and products that generate increasing traffic and market share.

·Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based and Al services on the growing array of computing devices, including
PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices.

.Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers.

·Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations and specific requirements of our customers and maintain the security of their
data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs.

·Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our
competitors.

It is uncertain whether our strategies will continue to attract users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not effective in executing
organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and
services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This could adversely affect our
operations, financial condition, and results of operations.

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="PART I Item 1A" -->

Our AI systems offer users powerful tools and capabilities. However, there may be instances where these systems are used in ways that are unintended
or inappropriate. In addition, some users may also engage in fraudulent or abusive activities through our cloud-based and AI services, such as
unauthorized account access, payment fraud, or terms of service violations including cryptocurrency mining or launching cyberattacks. While we are
committed to detecting and controlling such misuse of our cloud-based and AI services, our efforts may not be effective, and we may incur reputational
damage or experience adverse impacts to our business and results of operations.


## RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS

We make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will continue to make significant
investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including AI-based products and services. We
also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, and
gaming devices. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovation, developer support,
and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they
may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue
from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable or may not
achieve operating margins as high as we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features that drive post-sale monetization
opportunities. Our data-handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by
regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption. Developing
new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. We could experience significant delays in new releases or significant
problems in creating new products or services. These factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances could have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue making acquisitions and
entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. For example, in October 2023 we completed our acquisition
of Activision Blizzard, Inc. ("Activision Blizzard"). In January 2023 we announced the third phase of our OpenAl strategic partnership. Acquisitions and
other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an
unsatisfactory return on our investment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we have difficulty integrating and
retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced transactions
may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination
or renegotiation of the arrangement. We also have limited ability to control or influence third parties with whom we have arrangements, which may impact
our ability to realize the anticipated benefits. The success of these transactions and arrangements depend in part on our ability to leverage them to
enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones, as well as the acquired companies' ability to meet our policies and
processes in areas such as data governance, privacy, digital safety, responsible AI, and cybersecurity. It may take longer than expected to realize the full
economic benefits from these transactions and arrangements, such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be
smaller than we expected, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We have recorded, and may in the future be required to record, a
significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is
determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. In addition, an acquisition may be subject to challenge even after it has been completed. These
events could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.

# PART I Item 1A


# CYBERSECURITY, DATA PRIVACY, AND PLATFORM ABUSE RISKS


## Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive position.


### Security of our information technology

Threats to security can take a variety of forms. Threat actors, including individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including nation-
states, state-sponsored organizations, or cybercriminal groups, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our internal
infrastructure, and we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in which such actors have gained unauthorized access to our systems and data,
including customer systems and data. These actors use a wide variety of methods, which include developing and deploying malicious software; exploiting
known and potential vulnerabilities or intentionally designed processes in our or third-party hardware, software, or other infrastructure to attack our
products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters; using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or
customers to disclose sensitive information, such as passwords, or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users' or customers' data; or acting
in a coordinated manner or conducting coordinated attacks. For example, as previously disclosed in our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on January 19, 2024 and amended on March 8, 2024, beginning in late November 2023, a nation-state associated threat actor used a
password spray attack to compromise a legacy test account and, in turn, gain access to Microsoft email accounts. The threat actor used information it
obtained to gain unauthorized access to some of our source code repositories and internal systems, and the threat actor could continue to utilize this and
other information to attempt to gain access to our systems or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations. This incident has and may
continue to result in harm to our reputation and customer relationships. Nation-state and state-sponsored actors can sustain malicious activities for
extended periods and deploy significant resources to plan and carry out attacks. Nation-state attacks against us, our customers, or our partners have and
may continue to intensify due to our transparency to our customers, other stakeholders, and the public about cyberattacks, and during elections or
periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict. Challenges or failures in applying security patches to all hardware and devices connected to our systems,
including end-of-life and end-of-support equipment, have and may continue to result in unauthorized access to our systems and data in the future. Cyber
incidents and attacks, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, competitive position, and
reputation, or expose us to legal or regulatory risk.

Inadequate account security or organizational security practices, including those of companies we have acquired or those of the third parties we utilize,
have resulted and may result in unauthorized access to our systems and data, including customer systems and data. For example, passwords may not be
rotated and employee access may not be updated or removed on a timely basis. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our
users' security or systems or reveal confidential information, and laws in foreign jurisdictions may compel actions by such parties against our interests and
could limit our recourse. Malicious actors may employ the supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier
accounts or hardware.

Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully
defending against them. Threat actors may also utilize emerging technologies, such as AI and machine learning. Our current capabilities may not detect
certain vulnerabilities or new attack methods, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. It may be difficult to determine
the best way to investigate, mitigate, contain, and remediate the harm caused by a cyber incident. Such efforts may not be successful, and we may make
errors or fail to take necessary actions. It is possible that threat actors may gain undetected access to other networks and systems after establishing a
foothold on an internal system. Cyber incidents and attacks can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks
and systems, as well as those of our partners and customers. In addition, it may take considerable time for us to investigate and evaluate the full impact
of incidents, particularly for sophisticated attacks. As a result of these and other factors, we may not be able to provide prompt, full, and reliable
information about the incident to our customers, partners, regulators, and the public. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security can disrupt the
security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in
product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other
assets, subject us to ransomware attacks, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks, or otherwise
adversely affect our business. In addition, actions taken to remediate an incident could result in outages, data losses, and disruptions of our services.

Our internal environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new ways of sharing data and
communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies.
Increasing use of generative AI models in our internal systems may create new attack surfaces or methods for adversaries. Our business policies and
internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge or the emerging cybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions
worldwide.


### Security of our products, services, devices, and customers' data

The security of our products and services is important in our customers' decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud and on-
premises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us, whose business is providing technology products and services
to others. Threats to or attacks on our own infrastructure, such as the nation-state attack described in the prior risk factor, have also affected our
customers and may do so in the future. The reliability of our cloud-based services and the protection of customer data depend on the security of our
infrastructure, which includes hardware and other elements provided by third parties. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating
systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, as well as customers with sensitive data, and we expect that to continue. In addition,
adversaries can attack our customers' on-premises or cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown ("zero-day") vulnerabilities. Product
vulnerabilities can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers
exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers' systems. Adversaries will continue to attack
customers using our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that
information to compromise our users' accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security
practices may also result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer's use of
our products or services. Weaknesses in our development processes can result in vulnerabilities in our products. Open source software can also contain
vulnerabilities that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks as we increasingly incorporate open source software into our products.
Additionally, features that rely on generative AI can be susceptible to security threats.

Our customers operate complex systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many
years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and products, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current
security advances or standards. As a result, we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely
because a more secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers'
vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied sizes and technical sophistication use our technology, and consequently may still have limited
capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state-of-the-art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for
this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these
settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults.

Cyberattacks could adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. We are committed to notifying our
customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have actionable information for customers to help protect themselves. We are
also committed to providing guidance and support on detection, tracking, and remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these
attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves on-premises software such as
Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers' computing environments.

Any of the foregoing events could result in reputational harm, loss of revenue, increased costs, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

# PART I Item 1A


## Development and deployment of defensive measures

To defend against security threats to our internal infrastructure, our cloud-based services, and our customers' systems, we must take a complex and
multifaceted approach. This includes continuously engineering more secure products and services, and enhancing security, threat detection, and
reliability features. We must also escalate and improve our development processes and the deployment of software updates to address security
vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others in a timely manner. In addition, we must develop mitigation technologies that help
to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, and maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity
of our network, products, and services. Further, we must provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and
information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so.

The cost of these measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual
or perceived security vulnerabilities in our processes, products, and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation
and lead customers to exercise contractual or other remedies against us, reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to
use competing products or services. Customers and third parties granted access to customer systems may fail to update their systems, continue to run
software or operating systems we no longer support, may fail to timely install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security
practices. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products
or services. Customers in certain industries such as financial services, health care, and government have enhanced or specialized expectations and
requirements to which we must develop and engineer our products and services. Any of these could adversely affect our reputation and results of
operations. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our
exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter
into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers.

Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. If there is a security
vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could experience adverse impacts to our results of operations,
reputation, or competitive position.

Disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow the number, breadth, and scale of
our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of
high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the
security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third
parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors
store and manage. Relatedly, despite our efforts to continuously improve security controls, it is possible that we may fail to identify or mitigate insider
threat activities that could lead to the misuse of our systems or customer and user data. In addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer
or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or
users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services
also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or in a cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities
can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency
concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user
data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services
and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we take to
address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user
expectations or governmental rules or actions, may increase costs or hinder sales of our products and services.

We may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others. LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and services
contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. In certain cases, we have made commitments to our
members and users to limit access to or use of this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third
parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit which could adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

# Abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement.


## Advertising, professional, marketplace, and gaming platform abuses

For platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, our reputation or user
engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. This activity may come from users impersonating other people or
organizations, including through the use of AI technologies, dissemination of information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the
opinions of our users, or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. Preventing or
responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful,
adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and results of operations.


## Other digital safety abuses

Our consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used to find, generate, store, or disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our
terms or applicable law. We may not proactively discover such content due to scale, the limitations of existing technologies, and conflicting legal
frameworks. When discovered by users and others, such content may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement. Regulations
and other initiatives have been enacted to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online, and we expect this to continue
with focused attention on child safety. At the same time, regulations and other initiatives regarding freedom of expression may conflict with such content
moderation regulations. The legal and regulatory environment in this area is complex and continues to evolve across multiple jurisdictions. As a result,
there is considerable uncertainty regarding both current and future compliance obligations. Failure to comply with content requirements may subject us to
enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational damage, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results
of operations.

Our products and services, how they are used by customers, and how third-party products and services interact with them, may present
security, privacy, and execution risks. Our products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or
ineffective for their intended purposes. For example, customers control our products and services, including our AI products, within their environments,
and may deploy them in high-risk scenarios or utilize them inappropriately. Our products may also collect large amounts of data in manners which may
not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. Our customers also operate complex systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple
vendors whose products or personnel may take or fail to take actions which impact the reliability or security of our products and services. If our products
and services do not work as intended, are utilized in methods not intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal
claims or enforcement actions. These risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation, or adversely affect our results of operations.

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="PART I Item 1A" -->

Issues in the development, deployment, and use of AI may result in reputational or competitive harm or liability. We are building AI into many of
our offerings, including our productivity services, and we are also making AI available for our customers to use in solutions that they build. This AI may be
developed by Microsoft or others, including our strategic partner, OpenAI. We expect these elements of our business to grow. We envision a future in
which AI operating in devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. As with many
innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms or training methodologies may be
flawed. Datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased or inaccurate information. Content generated by AI systems may be offensive, illegal,
inaccurate, or otherwise harmful. Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by Microsoft or others could result in incidents that
impair the acceptance of AI solutions, cause harm to individuals, customers, or society, or result in our products and services not working as intended.
Human review of certain inputs and outputs may be required, including for agentic AI systems that can take actions autonomously. Our implementation of
AI systems could result in legal liability, regulatory action, brand, reputational, or competitive harm, or other adverse impacts. These risks may stem from
issues related to intellectual property, data privacy, and other claims associated with AI training and outputs. They are further compounded by the
evolving regulatory landscape, with new laws emerging globally, including the European Union ("EU"). Some Al scenarios present ethical issues or may
have broad impacts on society. There is also rising divergence globally in how to address these issues and impacts, with the result that we will need to
navigate a web of different tensions across geographies. Finally, if we enable or offer AI solutions that have unintended consequences, unintended
usage or customization by our customers and partners, are contrary to our responsible AI policies and practices, or are otherwise controversial because
of the impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, our reputation, competitive position, business, financial
condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.


# OPERATIONAL RISKS

We may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations
infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We
spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle
more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy,
networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units and other components. The cost or availability of these dependencies could be
adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the transition to a clean energy economy, local and regional environmental regulations, and
geopolitical disruptions. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth and the augmentation
of existing services, including through the incorporation of AI features and/or functionality. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform
and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and
complex, and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and reliability risks. It requires that we maintain
an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that
continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, outages, insufficient Internet
connectivity, insufficient or unavailable power or water supply, or inadequate storage and compute capacity could diminish the quality of our products,
services, and user experience, resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation,
and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition,
and results of operations.

We may experience supply or quality problems. There are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. We continue to identify
and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly
given the growing demand for AI services. Capacity available to us may be affected as competitors use some of the same suppliers and materials for
hardware components. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or
regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or
inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and continued development of our products and services. Component shortages, excess or
obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Datacenter servers, Xbox consoles, Surface
devices, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages
which could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.

<!-- PageBreak -->


# PART I Item 1A

Our software products and services also have and may in the future experience quality or reliability problems. The processes we use to develop our
software are imperfect. Like all software, our software contains bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers
increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are interdependent on one another. Our
products and services may be impacted by interaction with third-party products and services. Our customers may also utilize their own or third-party
products and services whose reliability is dependent on interaction with our products and services. Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the
impact of quality or reliability issues. Weaknesses in our processes could result in defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing, which could
cause reduced sales, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability, and could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or
limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge.

Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design and market are highly complex. Failure to prevent, detect,
or address defects in design, manufacture, or associated software could result in recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims, which could adversely
affect our business and results of operations.


# LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS

We are subject to a variety of new, existing, and evolving legal and regulatory requirements that could adversely affect our results of
operations. We are subject to a wide range of laws, regulations, and legal requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those that may apply to our
products and online services offerings, and those that impose requirements related to user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection,
digital accessibility, advertising, and online safety. Laws in several jurisdictions, including EU Member State laws under the European Electronic
Communications Code, increasingly define certain of our services as regulated services. This trend may continue with our offerings becoming subject to
additional data protection, security, digital safety, law enforcement surveillance, and other obligations. Regulators and private litigants may assert that our
collection, use, and management of customer data and other information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations, including laws that apply to the
tracking of users via technology such as cookies. In addition, laws requiring us to retrieve and produce customer data in response to compulsory legal
demands from law enforcement and governmental authorities are expanding and the requests we are experiencing are increasing in volume and
complexity.

New, existing, and evolving laws and regulations, or interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner inconsistent with our
interpretations of such laws and regulations or our practices, may result in modification of our products and services, altered business models and
operations, increased costs, reputational damage, and civil or criminal liability. Examples include laws and regulations regarding:

· Competition laws and new market regulation: Government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws.
Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations and enacting new regulations to intervene in digital markets, and this
includes markets such as the EU, the United Kingdom, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert
claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. and foreign antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize
our business. Competition law enforcement actions and court decisions along with new market regulations may result in fines or hinder our ability
to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that comes
from them. New competition law actions or obligations under market regulation schemes could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as
precedent.

· Al: Legislative and regulatory action is emerging in Al, which could increase costs or restrict opportunity. For example, the EU's Al Act may
increase costs or impact the provision or operation of our AI models and services in the European market. AI regulatory areas include model and
system development and deployment, frontier model safety, transparency, and content provenance.

· Anti-corruption: The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") and other anti-corruption laws and regulations ("Anti-Corruption Laws") prohibit
corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and
records and adequate internal controls. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be based
on reports from employees and others about our business activities and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Periodically, we receive such
reports directly and investigate them and also cooperate with investigations by U.S. and foreign law enforcement authorities.

<!-- PageBreak -->


# PART I Item 1A

· Trade: Increasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the U.S. relating
to trade and investment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries.
U.S. export controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products and services to, or making investments in, certain entities in specified
countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow
for government review of transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries.
Supply chain regulations may impact the availability of goods or result in additional regulatory scrutiny. Restrictions on data flows and outbound
investment and customer sensitivities may limit our ability to leverage parts of our global engineering footprint to provide services in certain
jurisdictions. Increased geopolitical instabilities and changing U.S. Administration priorities create an unpredictable trade landscape. U.S. tariff
and shifting AI export controls policies, like the AI Diffusion Rule, could increase operational costs, create uncertainty in the continuity of our
products, and accelerate sovereignty initiatives among international partners and customers. The volatility of U.S. tariffs has triggered economic
uncertainty and could impact cloud and devices supply chain cost competitiveness. The potential replacement of the recently rescinded AI
Diffusion Rule and other potential Al-related rulemakings could adversely affect Microsoft's business, strategy, and operations. Periods of
intense diplomatic or armed conflict like the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict could result in (1) new and rapidly evolving
sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and (2) negative impacts to regional trade
ecosystems among our customers, partners, and us.

· Cybersecurity: Legislative and regulatory actions related to cybersecurity may increase the costs associated with developing, implementing,
or securing our products and services. The legal and regulatory environment in this area is complex and continues to evolve across multiple
jurisdictions. As a result, there is considerable uncertainty regarding both current and future compliance obligations. This uncertainty increases
the risk that we may incur additional operational costs, face regulatory enforcement actions, or encounter challenges in the development and
deployment of our products.

· Handling of personal data: Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data globally continue to
evolve. The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies on the movement of data across national boundaries. Data
protection authorities and governments in the EU and other markets have and may again restrict and/or block the use of services that involve
the transfer of data across borders. New and evolving rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and
complexity of delivering our products and services. In addition, the EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and other similar
regulations impose a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. New requirements related to the use of data,
including the Data Act, add additional rules and restrictions on the use of data in our products and services.

· Environmental, Social, and Governance: Laws, regulations, and policies relating to environmental, social, and governance matters are being
developed and formalized in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere, which may include greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage caps, as well as
specific, target-driven environmental, social, and governance frameworks and disclosure requirements. In addition, in 2020 we announced goals
to become carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste by 2030. Any failure or perceived failure to meet our sustainability goals, or to meet
various sustainability regulatory requirements, could result in claims and lawsuits, regulatory actions, penalties, or damage to our reputation,
each of which could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations.

How these laws and regulations apply to our business is often unclear, subject to change, and sometimes may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction. In addition, governments' approach to enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with existing,
expanding, or new laws and regulations may involve significant costs and operational efforts, or require changes in products or business practices that
could adversely affect our results of operations. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties, criminal sanctions, or orders to cease the
alleged noncompliant activity. If our products do not meet customer expectations or legal requirements, we could face regulatory or legal actions, and our
business, operations, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="PART I Item 1A" -->

We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may
arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases, AI services, significant business transactions,
warranty or product claims, employment practices, and regulation. As we continue to expand our business and offerings, we may experience new and
novel legal claims. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely
affect our ability to conduct our business. Litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may
change in the future. An adverse impact to our financial condition and results of operations could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable
outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.

Our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. We derive substantial revenue from government contracts.
Government contracts and regulatory requirements can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements. For instance, we are
subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts, and we are required to provide assurance and attestations about our products
and processes. If we do not satisfy contractual or regulatory requirements, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor, we could
incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some agreements may allow a government to
terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval, reductions,
cancellations, or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products and services. These events could negatively impact our
financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.

We may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in
determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax
determination is uncertain. We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in tax laws, regulations,
and administrative practices and principles, including changes to the global tax framework, in various jurisdictions. In recent years, multiple domestic and
international tax proposals were proposed to impose greater tax burdens on large multinational enterprises. For example, the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals or guidance in international taxation, including the establishment of a global minimum
tax.

We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are
reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in
various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. We are currently under IRS audit for prior tax years and have received
Notices of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPAs") from the IRS for the tax years 2004 to 2013. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany
transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. The final resolution of the
proposed adjustments, and other audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and adversely affect
our results of operations in the period or periods in which that determination is made.

We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax
rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher
effective tax rates for the company. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other
global fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in taxing jurisdictions' administrative
interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.


# INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS

We face risks related to the protection and utilization of our intellectual property that may result in our business and operating results being
harmed. Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software, source code, and other intellectual
property on a global basis is difficult. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent
rights.

Changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology. Our increasing engagement with open source software
will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our results of
operations could be adversely affected.

<!-- PageBreak -->


# PART I Item 1A

Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. If our source code
leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying
functionality, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Unauthorized access to or disclosure of source code or other intellectual property also
increases the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors.

Third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property. From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights,
including current copyright infringement and other claims arising from AI training and output. To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty-bearing
data access or licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or
pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. Adverse outcomes could also include monetary damages or injunctive relief
that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. We have paid significant amounts to
settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage
this risk, and may continue to do so, which could adversely affect our results of operations.


# GENERAL RISKS

If our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and results of operations may be harmed. Our reputation and brands are globally
recognized and are important to our business. Our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector
customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. These include product safety or quality issues, our environmental
impact and sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy
groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions, public policy positions, or corporate philanthropic initiatives.
Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things:

· The introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners do not like.

·Public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, content, or development and deployment of Al.

·Data security breaches, cybersecurity incidents, responsible Al failures, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees.

Social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are damaged, it could adversely
affect our business, results of operations, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees.

Adverse economic or market conditions could harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, pandemic, or
other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our results of operations. If demand for computing power, PCs,
servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our results of operations could be
adversely affected.

Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a
significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could
cause sales channel disruption.

Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result,
allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.

We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and
interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment
portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government
credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio could be adversely affected and we could determine that
more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial condition and
results of operations.

<!-- PageBreak -->


# PART I Item 1A

Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems, operations, or supply chain
because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing
sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development
activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon
Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical
business or systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations or
adversely affect our results of operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our
systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential negative consequences of prolonged service outages.

Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, pose economic and other risks, which may
negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers, increase our operating costs, or otherwise disrupt our operations in markets both
directly and indirectly impacted by such events. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions
by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems
and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and global markets, hiring, and
profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers.
Any of these changes could adversely affect our results of operations. Changes in geopolitical conditions also increase the security risks described
elsewhere in these risk factors.

The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and
results of operations. The extent to which global pandemics impact our business going forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of
the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity, including the
possibility of recession or financial market instability. Measures to contain a global pandemic may intensify other risks described in these Risk Factors.

The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the
supply, demand, or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources,
necessary to run our business. Changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to
develop software and provide cloud-based services.

Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers, employees, and infrastructure are located throughout the world
and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical
risks. Global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, geopolitical tension, particularly between the U.S. and Europe, restrictions on
international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports, inflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes, could
adversely affect our results of operations. Non-compliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm,
operational delays, monetary fines, loss of revenue, increased costs, loss of export privileges, or criminal sanctions, which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of
social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and
protectionist trends and concerns about human rights, the environment, and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and
commercial environments. Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher
tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other developments that make it more
difficult to operate and sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact
demand for our products and services, impair our ability to operate in certain regions, or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our
international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could adversely affect
our results of operations.

## PART I Item 1A

Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on successfully attracting, training, and
retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our
industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as an inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive,
are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration
laws. Restraints on the flow of technical and professional talent, including those derived from changes to U.S. immigration policies or laws, may inhibit
our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled
workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services could be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is
also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder
our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased
operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. Our global workforce is predominantly non-unionized, although we do have some
employees in the U.S. and internationally who are represented by unions or works councils. In the U.S., there has been a general increase in workers
exercising their right to form or join a union. The unionization of significant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational
changes necessary to respond to changing conditions and to establish new relationships with worker representatives.

### ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that were
issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year 2025 that remain unresolved.


### ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY


#### RISK MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY

Microsoft plays a central role in the world's digital ecosystem. We have made it the top corporate priority to protect the computing environment used by
our customers and employees and to support the resiliency of our cloud infrastructure and services, products, devices, and our internal corporate
resources from determined adversaries. In response to the evolving cybersecurity threat landscape, we launched the Secure Future Initiative ("SFI") in
November 2023 and expanded the scope of SFI in May 2024. The SFI focuses our business strategy and efforts on continual improvement in
cybersecurity protection, and is aligned around three security principles:

· Secure by Design: Security comes first when designing any product or service.

· Secure by Default: Security protections are enabled and enforced by default, require no extra effort, and are not optional.

· Secure Operations: Security controls and monitoring will continuously be improved to meet current and future threats.

We operate a cybersecurity program and governance framework designed to protect our computing environments against cybersecurity threats, and we
have controls, policies, and procedures to identify, manage, and mitigate cybersecurity threats. Annually, we assess our cybersecurity program's
alignment with the National Institute of Standards & Technology's Cyber Security Framework ("NIST") and other applicable industry standards. We also
undertake integrated planning and preparedness activities to support business continuity and operational resiliency. We assess our program's
effectiveness through various exercises, including tabletop simulations and production environment tests, penetration and vulnerability tests, red team
exercises, and other related activities. We conduct mandatory cybersecurity training, provide employees with tools to report suspected incidents and
assess their own security posture, and conduct real-time simulated employee education exercises, such as phishing email campaigns designed to
emulate real-world attacks. We also engage in robust cybersecurity assessments and remediation efforts for acquired companies.

Our computing environments, products, and services are reviewed by our internal audit teams as well as independent third-party assessors. We are
committed to managing the most significant risks to our strategies and ambitions, including cybersecurity risks. The Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM")
organization supports management in this commitment by facilitating the semiannual risk assessment, which documents the priority and status of these
risks and aligns them with our strategic mitigation efforts. ERM is structured using a framework based on the Committee of Sponsoring Organization
("COSO") guidance on Enterprise Risk Management Integrating Strategy with Performance and it also aligns with the International Organization for
Standardization 31000:2018 Risk Management Standard.

We continuously monitor our computing environments, products, and services for vulnerabilities and signs of compromise, and we utilize our own security
products to combat cybersecurity threats. We integrate security into our computing environments, products, and services through our Security
Development Lifecycle ("SDL"). Our SDL introduces security and privacy considerations throughout all phases of our development process and through
the adoption of zero-trust end-to-end architecture. We utilize machine learning and AI-powered security tools to gain insights from 84 trillion signals per
day. We track over 1,500 unique threat actors, including more than 600 nation-state actors, 300 cybercriminal groups, 200 influence operation groups,
and hundreds of others. To support our efforts, we operate a Cyber Defense Operations Center connected to over 10,000 security and threat intelligence
experts, including engineers, researchers, data scientists, cybersecurity experts, threat hunters, geopolitical analysts, investigators, and frontline
responders across the globe.

<!-- PageBreak -->


# PART I Item 1C

When appropriate, we utilize external service providers to assess, test, or otherwise assist our program. We also leverage third parties by working with
external researchers, operating bug bounty programs, and managing coordinated vulnerability disclosure programs with security organizations. We
maintain a systematic approach to assessing and controlling the cybersecurity risks presented by third-party service providers. We require third-party
service providers to manage their cybersecurity risks in defined ways, undergo cybersecurity reviews, notify us of cyber events, and satisfy additional
contractual requirements.

We seek to improve the entire cybersecurity ecosystem through multistakeholder diplomacy to set and uphold expectations for state behavior,
advancement of government policy that strengthens cybersecurity and resiliency, disruption and deterrence of cybercrime, protection of national security
interests, and disruption of digital threats to democracies. We also establish processes and innovate solutions for us and our customers to address the
growing number and complexity of cybersecurity regulations.

When we experience a cybersecurity incident, we utilize our well-established incident response plans that operate both across the company and at the
product and services level. Incidents are first triaged for severity, and then more deeply assessed to establish a plan of record and activate internal and
external notification, disclosure, and communication plans, as applicable. Engineering and development resources are mobilized to resolve or remediate
the incident. After the incident is resolved, a comprehensive post-incident review process is conducted.

We describe the risks from cybersecurity threats, including previous cybersecurity incidents, in section "Risk Factors" (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K).
As of the date of this Form 10-K, we do not believe any risks from cybersecurity threats have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially
affect us, including our results of operations or financial condition. However, the cybersecurity threat environment is increasingly challenging, and we,
along with the entire digital ecosystem, are under constant and increasing threat. As discussed above, our business strategy is tied to the SFI and we are
committed to continuously monitoring cybersecurity threats, enhancing the security of our products, investing in our cybersecurity infrastructure, and
collaborating with peers, customers, service providers, regulators, and governments to advance our and the entire digital ecosystem's cybersecurity
defenses and resiliency.


# GOVERNANCE

Our Board of Directors oversees cybersecurity risk. Cybersecurity reviews by the Board are scheduled to occur at least quarterly, or more frequently as
determined to be necessary or advisable. Presentations to the Board of Directors are made by senior management, including our Chief Information
Security Officer ("CISO"), our EVP of Microsoft Security, our EVP of Cloud + Al, and the head of our Customer Security and Trust organization. The
presentations address topics such as cybersecurity threats, incidents, top risks and related remediation efforts, results from internal and third-party
assessments, progress towards risk-mitigation goals, the functioning of our incident response program, regulatory developments, and digital diplomacy
efforts. In addition, we have an escalation process in place to inform senior management and the Board of significant issues. Cybersecurity issues are
also considered during separate Board meeting discussions regarding important matters like ERM, audit issues, operational budgeting, business
continuity planning, mergers and acquisitions, brand management, and other relevant matters.

Our CISO leads the strategy, engineering, and operations of cybersecurity across the company, and reports to the EVP of Cloud + AI. Our CISO has
extensive experience assessing and managing cybersecurity programs and cybersecurity risk. Before joining Microsoft, our CISO served in a prior Chief
Technology Officer role as well as in senior leadership, engineering, and operational roles within multiple organizations. In addition to the Board's
oversight of cybersecurity risk, to support the CISO, we have established a Cybersecurity Governance Council ("CGC") charged with overseeing
initiatives that safeguard Microsoft's computing environments, products, and services. The CGC is comprised of an executive-level team of Deputy
CISOs with cybersecurity backgrounds and expertise relevant to their roles. The CGC responsibilities include approving our enterprise security risk
assessment process and results, determining the appropriate cybersecurity risk level and mitigations, reviewing the NIST CSF alignment, and supporting
compliance with cybersecurity regulations. Our cybersecurity efforts are supported directly by Microsoft's security and threat intelligence experts and our
employees across the company, all of whom receive cybersecurity awareness training and education and are expected to support our efforts.

## ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to help the reader
understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in
conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). This
section generally discusses the results of our operations for the year ended June 30, 2025 compared to the year ended June 30, 2024. For a discussion
of the year ended June 30, 2024 compared to the year ended June 30, 2023, please refer to Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024 and our Form 8-K filed on
December 3, 2024.


### OVERVIEW

Microsoft is a technology company committed to making digital technology and artificial intelligence ("Al") available broadly and doing so responsibly, with
a mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We create platforms and tools, powered by AI, that deliver
innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers.

We generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based solutions, content, and other services to people and businesses; licensing and supporting
an array of software products; delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience; and designing and selling devices. Our most significant
expenses are related to compensating employees; supporting and investing in our cloud-based services, including datacenter operations; designing,
manufacturing, marketing, and selling our other products and services; and income taxes.

Highlights from fiscal year 2025 compared with fiscal year 2024 included:

·Microsoft Cloud revenue increased 23% to $168.9 billion.

·Microsoft 365 Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 14% driven by Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue growth of
15%.

·Microsoft 365 Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 11% driven by Microsoft 365 Consumer cloud revenue growth of 11%.

·LinkedIn revenue increased 9%.

·Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 15% driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 19%.

·Server products and cloud services revenue increased 23% driven by Azure and other cloud services revenue growth of 34%.

·Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 3%.

·Xbox content and services revenue increased 16%.

.Search and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 20%.


#### Industry Trends and Opportunities

Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to
conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of
what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and
users, industry trends, and competitive forces.

Microsoft and OpenAI maintain a long-term strategic partnership originally established in 2019. Microsoft is a major investor in OpenAI, and the
companies have reciprocal revenue-sharing arrangements. We hold rights to OpenAl's intellectual property, including models and infrastructure, for
integration into our products. The OpenAI API is exclusive to Azure, runs on Azure, and is available through the Azure OpenAI Service. We also have a
right of first refusal on OpenAI's new capacity needs.

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="PART II Item 7" -->


#### Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks

The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and
devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve
rapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in some cases, the user's choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use.
Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.
We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.

The investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating
margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving
needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable
land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units ("GPUs") and other components. Our devices are
primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current
vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very
few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.

Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We
compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow
one's career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.

Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the
U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not have a material impact on reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in
fiscal year 2025.

Further, global, regional, and local economic developments and changes in global trade policies such as restrictions on international trade, including
tariffs and other controls on imports or exports, could result in increased supply chain challenges, cost volatility, and consumer and economic uncertainty
which may adversely affect our results of operations.

Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.


#### Seasonality

Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Fourth quarter revenue is driven by a higher volume of
multi-year contracts executed during the period.


#### Reportable Segments

We report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal
Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting.

In August 2024, we announced changes to the composition of our segments. These changes align our segments with how we currently manage our
business, most notably bringing the commercial components of Microsoft 365 together in the Productivity and Business Processes segment. Beginning in
fiscal year 2025, the information that our chief operating decision maker is regularly provided and reviews for purposes of allocating resources and
assessing performance reflects these segment changes. Prior period segment information has been recast to conform to the way we internally manage
and monitor our business during fiscal year 2025.

Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 18 - Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial
Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="PART II Item 7" -->


#### Metrics

We use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources. We disclose metrics
to enable investors to evaluate progress against our ambitions, provide transparency into performance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our
products and services. Our commercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and
services. The metrics are disclosed in the MD&A or the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Financial metrics are calculated
based on financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), and growth
comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last fiscal year.

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, we made updates to our metrics in connection with the segment changes described above. These changes align
our metrics with how we manage and monitor certain businesses. The key change was bringing the commercial components of Microsoft 365 together
and creating a new Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud revenue growth metric. Other changes include combining Windows OEM and Devices into a single
revenue growth metric that brings revenue from PC market-driven businesses together, as well as elevating our cloud revenue growth metrics to align to
our strategic focus on cloud growth.


#### Commercial

Our commercial business primarily consists of Server products and cloud services, Microsoft 365 Commercial products and cloud services, the
commercial portion of LinkedIn, Dynamics products and cloud services, and Enterprise and partner services. Our commercial metrics allow management
and investors to assess the overall health of our commercial business and include leading indicators of future performance.

# INCOME TAXES


## Effective Tax Rate

Our effective tax rate for both fiscal years 2025 and 2024 was 18%. Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 was primarily impacted
by changes in the mix of our earnings and tax expenses between the U.S. and foreign countries.

Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from
producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland.

The mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution
of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2025, our U.S. income before income taxes was $69.2 billion and our foreign
income before income taxes was $54.4 billion. In fiscal year 2024, our U.S. income before income taxes was $62.9 billion and our foreign income before
income taxes was $44.9 billion.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") published its model rules "Tax Challenges Arising From the Digitalisation of the
Economy - Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two)" which established a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% for certain multinational
enterprises. Many countries have implemented or are in the process of implementing the Pillar Two legislation, which applies to Microsoft beginning in
fiscal year 2025. While we do not currently estimate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements, we continue to monitor the impact as
countries implement legislation and the OECD provides additional guidance.

We are currently assessing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act ("OBBBA") which was enacted on July 4, 2025. The OBBBA provides a U.S. global intangible
low-taxed income effective tax rate of 14% effective fiscal year 2027 for Microsoft. It also provides bonus depreciation for certain assets placed into
service after January 19, 2025 and an election to expense U.S. incurred research or experimental expenditures.


## Uncertain Tax Positions

We remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023, we received
Notices of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPAs") from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the
IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of June 30, 2025, we believe our allowances for income tax
contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS's administrative appeals
office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information
currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.

We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S., some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of
these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. Our operations in Ireland remain subject to examination for tax years
2020 and thereafter.

# PART II Item 7


# LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient
to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities,
material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA"), for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the
foreseeable future.


## Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments

Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $94.6 billion and $75.5 billion as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Equity and other
investments were $15.4 billion and $14.6 billion as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate
liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and
individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to
diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income
portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is
insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.


## Valuation

In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial
instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual
funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar
assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2
investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed
securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable
inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.

A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted
market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a
quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in
which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments
based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to
demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure
appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and
independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.


## Cash Flows

Cash from operations increased $17.6 billion to $136.2 billion for fiscal year 2025, primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers, offset in
part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees and cash used to pay income taxes. Cash used in financing increased $13.9 billion to $51.7
billion for fiscal year 2025, primarily due to a $9.5 billion increase in cash used for repayments of debt, net of proceeds. Cash used in investing
decreased $24.4 billion to $72.6 billion for fiscal year 2025, primarily due to a $63.2 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of
cash acquired and divestitures, and purchases of intangible and other assets, offset in part by a $22.3 billion increase in cash used in net investment
purchases, sales, and maturities, and a $20.1 billion increase in additions to property and equipment.

## Debt Proceeds

We issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating. The proceeds of these issuances were
or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of
capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. Refer to Note 10 - Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-
K).


## Unearned Revenue

Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include cloud services and Software Assurance
("SA"). Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over
the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when
we transfer control of the product or service. Refer to Note 1 - Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-
K).

The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2025:

If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the
associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption,
as applicable. Refer to Note 12 - Unearned Revenue of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).

<!-- PageHeader="PART II Item 7" -->


## Income Taxes

As a result of the TCJA, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax. Under the
TCJA, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year
seven, and 25% in year eight. As of June 30, 2025, our eighth transition tax installment of $4.4 billion is short-term and payable in the first quarter of
fiscal year 2026.


## Share Repurchases

During fiscal years 2025 and 2024, we repurchased 31 million shares and 32 million shares of our common stock for $13.0 billion and $12.0 billion,
respectively, through our share repurchase program. All repurchases were made using cash resources. As of June 30, 2025, $57.3 billion remained of
our $60 billion share repurchase program. Refer to Note 15 - Stockholders' Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-
K).


## Dividends

During fiscal years 2025 and 2024, our Board of Directors declared dividends totaling $24.7 billion and $22.3 billion, respectively. We intend to continue
returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends, subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. Refer to Note 15 - Stockholders' Equity of the
Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).


## Other Planned Uses of Capital

We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as acquisitions that
align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for
research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We will continue to invest in capital expenditures to support growth in
our cloud offerings and our investments in AI infrastructure and training. We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices,
research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or
arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.


# RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

Refer to Note 1 - Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).


# CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical
accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial
condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities,
goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, and income taxes.


## Revenue Recognition

Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services
are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-
based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is
considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain
cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and
cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which
the cloud services are provided.

<!-- PageBreak -->


# PART II

<!-- PageNumber="Item 7" -->

Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price ("SSP") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP
for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range
of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated
based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.

In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using
information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services
due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of
the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.

Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern
of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.

Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of
our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits
are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated
variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.


## Impairment of Investment Securities

We review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other
factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination
requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative
evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and
business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before
recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the
investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.

Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is
impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to
estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an
impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net.


## Goodwill

We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on
an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit
level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or
circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances
could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a
significant portion of a reporting unit.

Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to
reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is
estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future
cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which
cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.

The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other
factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting
unit.

<!-- PageHeader="PART II Item 7" -->


### Research and Development Costs

Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a software product to be marketed or sold to external users are charged to expense until
technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product
is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have
determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding
and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue
over the estimated life of the products.


### Legal and Other Contingencies

The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such
as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of
probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially
impact our consolidated financial statements.


### Income Taxes

The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities
and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity's financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax
benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based
on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest
benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of
income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax
positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our
consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our
consolidated financial statements.

## STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. The
consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management's estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are
safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements
and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of
responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.

The Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States).

The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets periodically with management,
internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters
concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit
Committee.

## ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK


### RISKS

We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. We use derivatives instruments to manage
these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements.


#### Foreign Currencies

Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize
the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions, including hedges. Principal currency exposures include the Euro, Japanese yen, British
pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.


#### Interest Rate

Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of the
fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixed-income indices.


#### Credit

Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We manage credit exposures relative to broad-based
indices to facilitate portfolio diversification.


#### Equity

Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to price risk.


### SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

The following table sets forth the potential loss in future earnings or fair values, including associated derivatives, resulting from hypothetical changes in
relevant market rates or prices:

# NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1 - ACCOUNTING POLICIES


## Accounting Principles

Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America ("GAAP").


## Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have
been eliminated.


## Recast of Certain Prior Period Information

In August 2024, we announced changes to the composition of our segments. These changes align our segments with how we currently manage our
business, most notably bringing the commercial components of Microsoft 365 together in the Productivity and Business Processes segment. Beginning in
fiscal year 2025, the information that our chief operating decision maker is regularly provided and reviews for purposes of allocating resources and
assessing performance reflects these segment changes. Prior period segment information has been recast to conform to the way we internally manage
and monitor our business during fiscal year 2025. These changes primarily impacted Note 8 - Goodwill, Note 12 - Unearned Revenue, and Note 18 -
Segment Information and Geographic Data.

The recast of prior period information had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows
statements.


## Estimates and Assumptions

Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue,
and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance
obligations, and determining the standalone selling price ("SSP") of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as
product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units;
product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when
technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated
financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from
management's estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.


## Foreign Currencies

Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated
at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive
income.


## Revenue


### Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue

Product revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity and collaboration applications, server applications, business solution
applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and
entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.

Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as
Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and gaming; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online
advertising and LinkedIn.

<!-- PageHeader="PART II" -->
<!-- PageNumber="Item 8" -->


## Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to
receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are
generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any
taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.


### Nature of Products and Services

Licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers
may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over
which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software
is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional
charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license.

Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either
a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period.
Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the
customer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual
components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided.

Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance ("SA"). SA
conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and
use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is
generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct
performance obligations that are satisfied over time.

Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue
has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided.

Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system.
In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time
when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.

Refer to Note 18 - Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering.


### Significant Judgments

Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services
are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-
based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is
considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain
cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and
cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which
the cloud services are provided.

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="PART II" -->
<!-- PageNumber="Item 8" -->

Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold
separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate
SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative
SSP of the various products and services.

In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using
information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services
due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of
the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.

Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern
of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.

Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of
our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits
are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated
variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.


## Contract Balances and Other Receivables

Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing,
or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the
beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an
unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses.

Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include cloud services and SA. Unearned
revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage
period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions,
Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn
the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.

Refer to Note 12 - Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the
period.

Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where
the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing
component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and
services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a
subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue
recognized upfront.

As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $5.2 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, and
is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, other receivables related to activities to facilitate the purchase of server components were $8.2 billion and $10.5 billion,
respectively, and are included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

We record financing receivables when we offer certain customers the option to acquire our software products and services offerings through a financing
program in a limited number of countries. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, our financing receivables, net were $4.3 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, for
short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="PART II Item 8" -->

We record an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects our best estimate of credit losses inherent in the accounts receivable and financing
receivable balances. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.


## Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer

We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one
year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were
immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

We apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have
been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales organization compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we
have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities.


## Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue includes: costs incurred to support and maintain cloud-based and other online products and services, including datacenter costs and
royalties; manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and
product distribution centers; traffic acquisition costs to drive traffic to our websites and to acquire online advertising space; and costs associated with the
delivery of consulting services.


## Research and Development

Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses
associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs and the
depreciation and amortization of assets used to conduct research and development. Such costs related to software development are included in research
and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products is generally shortly before the products
are released to production. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives
of the products.


## Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses
associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs
are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $2.1 billion, $1.7 billion, and $904 million in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.


## Stock-Based Compensation

Compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units ("RSUs") and performance stock units ("PSUs"), is measured at the fair value
on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards
is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period.
We measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method and
for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method.

Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP") is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is
recognized in the period of purchase.

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="PART II Item 8" -->


## Income Taxes

Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses
are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income
taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred
income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets.


## Financial Instruments


### Investments

We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair
values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and
remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as
short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current
operations.

Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair
value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market
information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general
market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ
a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to
the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to
sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new
cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.

Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are
measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the
measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the
fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.

Investments that are considered variable interest entities ("VIEs") are evaluated to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, in which
case we would be required to consolidate the entity. We evaluate whether we have (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the
VIE's economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the
VIE. We have determined we are not the primary beneficiary of any of our VIE investments. Therefore, our VIE investments are not consolidated and the
majority are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We have an investment in OpenAl Global, LLC ("OpenAI") and have made total
funding commitments of $13 billion. The investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.


### Derivatives

Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a
derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.

For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and
losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other
income (expense), net.

For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and
subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components
excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="PART II" -->
<!-- PageNumber="Item 8" -->

For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income
(expense), net.


## Fair Value Measurements

We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in
measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:

· Level 1 - inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments include U.S.
government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded
on exchanges.

· Level 2- inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in
markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable
in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these
models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest
rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial
paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and
bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter
forward, option, and swap contracts.

· Level 3 - inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and
discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and
goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are
significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.

We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are determined
based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash
flow projections.

Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.


## Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated
useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: software developed or
acquired for internal use, three years; computer equipment, two to six years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements,
three to 15 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.


## Leases

We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets, other current
liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current
liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="PART II" -->
<!-- PageNumber="Item 8" -->

ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising
from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over
the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of
interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any
lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain
that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain equipment leases, such as
vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a
portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities.


## Goodwill

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and
between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its
carrying value.


## Intangible Assets

Our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized over the estimated useful life in proportion to the economic benefits received. We
evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful
lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.


## Related Party Transactions

In March 2024, we entered into an agreement with Inflection Al, Inc. ("Inflection"), pursuant to which we obtained a non-exclusive license to Inflection's
intellectual property. Reid Hoffman, a member of our Board of Directors, is a co-founder of and serves on the board of directors of Inflection. As of the
date of the agreement with Inflection, Reprogrammed Interchange LLC ("Reprogrammed") and entities affiliated with Greylock Ventures ("Greylock")
each held less than a 10% equity interest in Inflection. Mr. Hoffman may be deemed to beneficially own the shares held by Reprogrammed and Greylock
by virtue of his relationship with such entities. Mr. Hoffman did not participate in any portions of the meetings of our Board of Directors or any committee
thereof to review and approve the transaction with Inflection.


## Recent Accounting Guidance


### Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance


### Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures

In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued a new standard to improve reportable segment disclosures. The guidance
expands the disclosures required for reportable segments in our annual and interim consolidated financial statements, primarily through enhanced
disclosures about significant segment expenses. We adopted the standard beginning with our annual reporting for fiscal year 2025. The adoption
resulted in incremental segment reporting disclosures, most notably disclosure of cost of revenue and operating expenses for each reportable segment.
Refer to Note 18 - Segment Information and Geographic Data.


### Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted


#### Income Taxes - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures

In December 2023, the FASB issued a new standard to improve income tax disclosures. The guidance requires disclosure of disaggregated income
taxes paid, prescribes standardized categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation, and modifies other income tax-related
disclosures. The standard will be effective for us beginning with our annual reporting for fiscal year 2026, with early adoption permitted. We are currently
evaluating the impact of this standard on our income tax disclosures.

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="PART II Item 8" -->


#### Income Statement - Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses

In November 2024, the FASB issued a new standard to expand disclosures about income statement expenses. The guidance requires disaggregation of
certain costs and expenses included in each relevant expense caption on our consolidated income statements in a separate note to the financial
statements at each interim and annual reporting period, including amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and
intangible asset amortization. The standard will be effective for us beginning with our annual reporting for fiscal year 2028 and interim periods thereafter,
with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our disclosures.


# NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted
EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding
during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.

Equity investments presented as "Other" in the tables above include investments without readily determinable fair values measured at cost with
adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments, measured using the equity method, or measured at fair value using net asset value as a
practical expedient which are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, equity investments without readily determinable
fair values measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments were $2.9 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. Equity
investments measured using the equity method were $6.0 billion as of both June 30, 2025 and 2024.

# PART II Item 8


## NOTE 5 - DERIVATIVES

We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, interest rates, equity prices, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and
to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of
these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment.


### Foreign Currencies

Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize
the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions.

Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow
hedging instruments.

Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance
sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.


### Interest Rate

Interest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedging instruments to
effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.

Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our
fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using option, futures, and swap contracts.
These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in "Other contracts" in the tables below.


### Equity

Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options, futures, and swap contracts. These
contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.


### Credit

Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts to manage credit
exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are
included in "Other contracts" in the tables below.


### Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features

Certain counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to
maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements,
we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2025, our long-term
unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted.

# NOTE 7 - BUSINESS COMBINATIONS


## Activision Blizzard, Inc.

On October 13, 2023, we completed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. ("Activision Blizzard") for a total purchase price of $75.4 billion, consisting
primarily of cash. Activision Blizzard is a leader in game development and an interactive entertainment content publisher. The acquisition will accelerate
the growth in our gaming business across mobile, PC, console, and cloud gaming. The financial results of Activision Blizzard have been included in our
consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. Activision Blizzard is reported as part of our More Personal Computing segment.

The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was completed as of September 30, 2024. The major classes of assets
and liabilities to which we have allocated the purchase price were as follows:


<table>
<tr>
<td>(In millions)</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Cash and cash equivalents</td>
<td>$ 12,976</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Goodwill</td>
<td>51,001</td>

<tr>

<td>(4,676)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Other liabilities</td>
<td>(3,620)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Total purchase price</td>
<td>$ 75,408</td>
</tr>
</table>


Goodwill was assigned to our More Personal Computing segment. The goodwill was primarily attributed to increased synergies that are expected to be
achieved from the integration of Activision Blizzard. Substantially all of the goodwill is expected to be non-deductible for income tax purposes.

Following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired:


<table>
<tr>
<th>(In millions, except average life)</th>

These pro forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which we believe are reasonable. They are not the results that would have been
realized had we been a combined company during the periods presented and are not necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations in
future periods. The pro forma results include adjustments related to purchase accounting, primarily amortization of intangible assets. Acquisition costs
and other nonrecurring charges were immaterial and are included in the earliest period presented.

We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor our business. Refer to Note 1 - Accounting
Policies for further information.

The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that
existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in
the amounts allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are determined.

Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as "Other" in the
table above. Also included in "Other" are business dispositions and transfers between segments due to reorganizations, as applicable.

As discussed in Note 1 - Accounting Policies, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 we made changes to our segments. These segment changes
also resulted in changes to our reporting units. We reallocated goodwill across impacted reporting units using a relative fair value approach. In addition,
we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all reporting units immediately prior to the reallocation and determined that no
impairment existed.


## Goodwill Impairment

We test goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-
adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the
businesses.

No instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2025, May 1, 2024, or May 1, 2023 tests. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, accumulated goodwill
impairment was $11.3 billion.

The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions
resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland. In fiscal years 2025, 2024,
and 2023, our foreign regional operating center in Ireland, which is taxed at a rate lower than the U.S. rate, generated 81%, 83%, and 81% of our foreign
income before tax. Other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits and the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax, and in fiscal year
2024, includes tax benefits from tax law changes. In fiscal year 2024, tax benefits from tax law changes primarily relate to the delay of the effective date
of final foreign tax credit regulations. In fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, there were no individually significant other reconciling items.

# PART II Item 8

The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024 was due to changes in the mix of our earnings and tax expenses
between the U.S. and foreign countries. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to tax
benefits from tax law changes, including the delay of the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations.

Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and
are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid or recovered.

As of June 30, 2025, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $390 million, $836 million, and $2.6 billion, respectively. The
federal and state net operating loss carryforwards have varying expiration dates ranging from fiscal year 2026 to 2045 or indefinite carryforward periods,
if not utilized. The majority of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. Certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to
an annual limitation but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. As of June 30, 2025, we had $816
million federal capital loss carryforwards for U.S. tax purposes. The federal capital loss carryforwards will expire in fiscal year 2030 if not utilized.

The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards, federal capital loss carryforwards, and other
net deferred tax assets that may not be realized.

Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $28.7 billion, $23.4 billion, and $23.1 billion in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

## Uncertain Tax Positions

Gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, were $24.7 billion, $22.8 billion, and $17.1 billion,
respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the resulting tax benefit would
affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 by $21.2 billion, $19.6 billion, and $14.4 billion, respectively.

As of June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $8.2 billion, $6.8 billion, and $5.2 billion,
respectively, net of income tax benefits. The provision for income taxes for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 included interest expense related to
uncertain tax positions of $1.3 billion, $1.5 billion, and $918 million, respectively, net of income tax benefits.

We remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023, we received
Notices of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPAs") from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the
IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of June 30, 2025, we believe our allowances for income tax
contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS's administrative appeals
office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information
currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.

We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S., some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of
these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. Our operations in Ireland remain subject to examination for tax years
2020 and thereafter.

approximately 40% of our total company remaining performance obligation revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter.


# NOTE 13 - LEASES

We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain
equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of less than 1 year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years,
and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year.

between fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2031 with lease terms of 1 year to 20 years.


# NOTE 14 - CONTINGENCIES


## Irish Data Protection Commission Matter

In 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission ("IDPC") began investigating a complaint against Linkedln as to whether LinkedIn's targeted advertising
practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). Microsoft cooperated throughout the period
of inquiry. In October 2024, the IDPC provided LinkedIn with a final decision alleging GDPR violations and assessing a fine. In November 2024, LinkedIn
appealed the final decision to the Irish courts, and the next hearing is scheduled for December 2025.

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="PART II Item 8" -->


## Other Contingencies

We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management
currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial
statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future.

As of June 30, 2025, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $541 million. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that
we estimate could reach approximately $600 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to
occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become
reasonably estimable.

# NOTE 17 - EMPLOYEE STOCK AND SAVINGS PLANS

We grant stock-based compensation to employees and directors. Awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares generally become
available for issuance under the plans. We issue new shares of Microsoft common stock to satisfy vesting of awards granted under our stock plans. We
also have an ESPP for all eligible employees.

Stock-based compensation expense and related income tax benefits were as follows:

## Stock Plans

Stock awards entitle the holder to receive shares of Microsoft common stock as the award vests. Stock awards generally vest over a service period of
four years or five years.


## Executive Incentive Plan

Under the Executive Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee approves stock awards to executive officers and certain senior executives. RSUs
generally vest ratably over a service period of four years. PSUs generally vest over a performance period of three years. The number of shares the PSU
holder receives is based on the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved.


## Activity for All Stock Plans

The fair value of stock awards was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:


<table>
<tr>
<th>Year Ended June 30,</th>

As of June 30, 2025, total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock awards were $21.6 billion. These costs are expected to be recognized over
a weighted average period of three years. The weighted average grant-date fair value of stock awards granted was $413.90, $339.46, and $252.59 for
fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The fair value of stock awards vested was $16.2 billion, $16.0 billion, and $11.9 billion, for fiscal years
2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. As of June 30, 2025, an aggregate of 98 million shares were authorized for future grant under our stock plans.

## Savings Plans

We have savings plans in the U.S. that qualify under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, and a number of savings plans in international
locations. Eligible U.S. employees may contribute a portion of their salary into the savings plans, subject to certain limitations. We match a portion of
each dollar a participant contributes into the plans. Employer-funded retirement benefits for all plans were $1.8 billion, $1.7 billion, and $1.6 billion in
fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and were expensed as contributed.


# NOTE 18 - SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), who is also our Chief Executive Officer, reviews
certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements. The primary profitability measure used by the CODM to review
segment operating results is operating income. The CODM uses operating income to allocate resources during our annual planning process and
throughout the year, as well as to assess the performance of our segments, primarily by monitoring actual results compared to prior periods and expected
results. During the periods presented, we reported our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes,
Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.

We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor our business. Refer to Note 1 - Accounting
Policies for further information.

Our reportable segments are described below.


## Productivity and Business Processes

Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information
services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises:

·Microsoft 365 Commercial products and cloud services, including Microsoft 365 Commercial cloud, comprising Microsoft 365 Commercial,
Enterprise Mobility + Security, the cloud portion of Windows Commercial, the per-user portion of Power BI, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft
Teams, Microsoft 365 Security and Compliance, and Microsoft 365 Copilot; and Microsoft 365 Commercial products, comprising Windows
Commercial on-premises and Office licensed on-premises.

·Microsoft 365 Consumer products and cloud services, including Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions, Office licensed on-premises, and other
consumer services.

·LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions.

· Dynamics products and cloud services, including Dynamics 365, comprising a set of intelligent, cloud-based applications across ERP, CRM,
Power Apps, and Power Automate; and on-premises ERP and CRM applications.

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="PART II" -->
<!-- PageNumber="Item 8" -->


## Intelligent Cloud

Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that power modern business and developers.
This segment primarily comprises:

.Server products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services, comprising cloud and Al consumption-based services, GitHub
cloud services, Nuance Healthcare cloud services, virtual desktop offerings, and other cloud services; and Server products, comprising SQL
Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, related Client Access Licenses ("CALs"), and other on-premises offerings.

· Enterprise and partner services, including Enterprise Support Services, Industry Solutions, Nuance professional services, Microsoft Partner
Network, and Learning Experience.


## More Personal Computing

Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the experience with our technology. This
segment primarily comprises:

·Windows and Devices, including Windows OEM licensing (Windows Pro and non-Pro licenses sold through the OEM channel) and Devices,
comprising Surface and PC accessories.

.Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first- and third-party content (including games and in-game
content), Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming, advertising, and other cloud services.

.Search and news advertising, comprising Bing and Copilot, Microsoft News, Microsoft Edge, and third-party affiliates.

Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue
recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on
the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or
estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are
allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based
on relative gross margin.

In addition, certain costs are incurred at a corporate level and allocated to our segments. These allocated costs generally include legal, including
settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise taxes, field selling, shared facilities services, customer service and
support, and severance incurred as part of a corporate program. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of
the costs being allocated and is generally based on relative gross margin or relative headcount.

# REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


## To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation


### Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2025
and 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity, for each of the three
years in the period ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the
Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated July 30, 2025, expressed an
unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.


### Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with
respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included
performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


### Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the
financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters
below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="PART II Item 8" -->


## Revenue Recognition - Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements


### Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company offers customers the ability to acquire
multiple licenses of software products and services, including cloud-based services, in its customer agreements through its volume licensing
programs.

Significant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for certain customer agreements, and includes the
following:

·Determination of whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus
together, such as software licenses and related services that are sold with cloud-based services.

. The pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each distinct performance obligation.

· Identification and treatment of contract terms that may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized (e.g., variable consideration, optional
purchases, and free services).

· Determination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation and for products and services that are not sold separately.

Given these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit effort in evaluating management's judgments in determining revenue
recognition for certain customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree of auditor judgment.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our principal audit procedures related to the Company's revenue recognition for certain customer agreements included the following:

.We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the identification of distinct performance obligations, the determination of the timing of revenue
recognition, and the estimation of variable consideration.

.We evaluated management's significant accounting policies related to certain customer agreements for reasonableness.

.We selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following procedures:

oObtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including master agreements, and other documents that were
part of the agreement.

oTested management's identification and treatment of contract terms.

oAssessed the terms in the customer agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of management's application of their
accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions.

.We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimate of stand-alone selling prices for products and services that are not sold separately.

.We tested the mathematical accuracy of management's calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the financial
statements.

## Income Taxes - Uncertain Tax Positions - Refer to Note 11 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company's long-term income taxes liability includes uncertain tax positions related to transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the
Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). The Company remains under IRS audit, or subject to IRS audit, for tax years subsequent to 2003. During fiscal
year 2024, the Company received Notices of Proposed Adjustments ("NOPAs") for the tax years 2004 to 2013, primarily related to intercompany
transfer pricing. While the Company has settled a portion of the IRS audits, resolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on
the Company's financial statements.

Conclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment and include complex
considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-year audit settlements. Given the complexity and the
subjective nature of certain transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the IRS, evaluating management's estimates relating to their
determination of uncertain tax positions required a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our principal audit procedures to evaluate management's estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved transfer pricing issues
included the following:

.We evaluated management's methods and assumptions used in the measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included
testing the effectiveness of the related internal controls.

.We tested the reasonableness of management's judgments regarding the future resolution of uncertain tax positions, as follows:

oWe evaluated whether management had appropriately considered new information that could significantly change the
measurement of the uncertain tax positions.

oWe evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimates by considering how changes in tax law, including statutes,
regulations, and recent case law, impacted management's judgments.

.We evaluated the appropriateness of the disclosures in relation to the underlying facts, judgments, and conclusions.

# ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Not applicable.


# ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated
the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this
report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures
are effective.


## REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over
financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in
reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for
preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in
accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets
that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial
statements would be prevented or detected.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation,
management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2025. There were no changes in our
internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025; their
report is included in Item 9A.

# PART II Item 9A


## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


### To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation


#### Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2025, based
on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June
30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2025, of the Company and our report dated July 30, 2025, expressed an
unqualified opinion on those financial statements.


#### Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a
public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


#### Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
