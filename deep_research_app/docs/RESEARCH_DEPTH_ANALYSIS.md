# Research Depth Implementation Analysis & Recommendations

## Current State Analysis

### 1. **How Depth Parameter is Currently Used**

#### Frontend Definition:
- **Quick**: "Fast overview (5-10 min)"
- **Standard**: "Balanced analysis (15-20 min)"  
- **Comprehensive**: "Deep analysis (30-40 min)" ✅ Default
- **Exhaustive**: "Complete analysis (1+ hour)"

#### Backend Reality:
**The depth parameter is currently NOT meaningfully used!**

```python
# In main.py line 524 - Only mentioned in context string
task=f"Create a comprehensive research plan for the topic: {topic}. 
      Context: depth={depth}, max_sources={max_sources}"
```

**Key Issues:**
1. ❌ Same prompts used regardless of depth
2. ❌ No variation in number of research iterations
3. ❌ No depth-specific agent instructions
4. ❌ Timeout is fixed at 3600s (1 hour) for all depths
5. ❌ max_sources defaults to 10 regardless of depth
6. ✅ Only passed as string context to AI (which may or may not use it)

## Real-World Implementation Recommendations

### **Level 1: Immediate Improvements (Can implement today)**

#### 1.1 Depth-Driven Configuration
```python
DEPTH_CONFIGS = {
    "quick": {
        "max_sources": 5,
        "research_aspects": 2,  # Core concepts + current state only
        "synthesis_iterations": 1,
        "report_min_words": 500,
        "report_max_words": 1500,
        "timeout": 300,  # 5 minutes
        "detail_level": "overview"
    },
    "standard": {
        "max_sources": 10,
        "research_aspects": 3,  # Add challenges
        "synthesis_iterations": 2,
        "report_min_words": 1500,
        "report_max_words": 3000,
        "timeout": 900,  # 15 minutes
        "detail_level": "detailed"
    },
    "comprehensive": {
        "max_sources": 20,
        "research_aspects": 5,  # All 5 aspects
        "synthesis_iterations": 3,
        "report_min_words": 3000,
        "report_max_words": 6000,
        "timeout": 2400,  # 40 minutes
        "detail_level": "comprehensive"
    },
    "exhaustive": {
        "max_sources": 50,
        "research_aspects": 5,
        "synthesis_iterations": 5,  # Multiple refinement passes
        "report_min_words": 6000,
        "report_max_words": 15000,
        "timeout": 7200,  # 2 hours
        "detail_level": "exhaustive",
        "enable_fact_checking": True,
        "enable_multi_perspective": True
    }
}
```

#### 1.2 Depth-Specific Prompts
```python
DEPTH_PROMPTS = {
    "quick": {
        "planner": "Create a focused research plan covering the essential aspects of {topic}. Prioritize breadth over depth.",
        "researcher": "Provide a concise overview focusing on key facts and main points.",
        "writer": "Write a clear, concise report (500-1500 words) with essential insights."
    },
    "standard": {
        "planner": "Create a balanced research plan for {topic} covering major aspects with moderate depth.",
        "researcher": "Provide detailed analysis with supporting evidence and examples.",
        "writer": "Write a comprehensive report (1500-3000 words) with analysis and insights."
    },
    "comprehensive": {
        "planner": "Create a thorough research plan for {topic} examining all major dimensions.",
        "researcher": "Conduct deep investigation with extensive evidence, multiple perspectives, and critical analysis.",
        "writer": "Write an in-depth research report (3000-6000 words) with detailed analysis, evidence, and nuanced insights."
    },
    "exhaustive": {
        "planner": "Create an exhaustive research plan for {topic} covering all aspects, edge cases, and interconnections.",
        "researcher": "Conduct comprehensive investigation leaving no stone unturned. Include historical context, future implications, comparative analysis, and expert opinions.",
        "writer": "Write a scholarly research report (6000-15000 words) with comprehensive analysis, extensive evidence, multiple perspectives, critical evaluation, and actionable recommendations."
    }
}
```

### **Level 2: Advanced Techniques**

#### 2.1 Iterative Refinement Pattern
```python
async def exhaustive_research_with_refinement(topic, config):
    """For exhaustive mode: Multiple passes with increasing depth"""
    
    # Pass 1: Broad sweep
    initial_findings = await broad_research(topic, sources=20)
    
    # Pass 2: Identify knowledge gaps
    gaps = await analyze_gaps(initial_findings)
    
    # Pass 3: Deep dive into gaps
    gap_research = await targeted_research(gaps, sources=15)
    
    # Pass 4: Cross-reference and validate
    validated = await cross_validate(initial_findings + gap_research)
    
    # Pass 5: Expert synthesis
    final_report = await expert_synthesis(validated)
    
    return final_report
```

#### 2.2 Multi-Perspective Analysis (Exhaustive Only)
```python
perspectives = [
    "technical_expert",      # Technical accuracy
    "business_analyst",      # Business implications  
    "academic_researcher",   # Scholarly rigor
    "industry_practitioner", # Practical applications
    "critic"                 # Challenge assumptions
]

# Each perspective reviews and adds insights
for perspective in perspectives:
    findings = await analyze_from_perspective(topic, perspective, findings)
```

#### 2.3 Progressive Disclosure Pattern
```python
# Start with quick research, expand based on findings
results = await quick_research(topic)

if depth == "comprehensive" or depth == "exhaustive":
    # Identify interesting subtopics
    subtopics = extract_subtopics(results)
    
    # Deep dive into each
    for subtopic in subtopics:
        deep_results = await deep_dive(subtopic)
        results.merge(deep_results)
```

#### 2.4 Fact-Checking Layer (Exhaustive)
```python
async def fact_check_claims(report):
    """Verify major claims with additional sources"""
    claims = extract_claims(report)
    
    for claim in claims:
        verification = await verify_claim(claim, min_sources=3)
        claim.confidence_score = verification.score
        claim.supporting_sources = verification.sources
    
    return add_confidence_scores(report, claims)
```

---

## Concrete Code Changes Needed

### 1. Update `execute_research_programmatically` function:
```python
# Get depth configuration
depth_config = DEPTH_CONFIGS.get(depth, DEPTH_CONFIGS["comprehensive"])

# Update max_sources from config
max_sources = depth_config["max_sources"]

# Update prompts based on depth
planner_prompt = DEPTH_PROMPTS[depth]["planner"].format(topic=topic)
researcher_prompt = DEPTH_PROMPTS[depth]["researcher"]
writer_prompt = DEPTH_PROMPTS[depth]["writer"]
```

### 2. Update YAML workflow:
```yaml
timeout: ${depth_config.timeout}  # Dynamic based on depth

# Add depth-specific instructions
- id: create_research_plan
  parameters:
    task: "${planner_prompt}"
    context:
      depth: "${research_depth}"
      max_sources: "${depth_config.max_sources}"
      detail_level: "${depth_config.detail_level}"
      target_words: "${depth_config.report_min_words}-${depth_config.report_max_words}"
```

### 3. Add validation step:
```python
# After report generation
if depth in ["comprehensive", "exhaustive"]:
    validation_result = await validate_research_quality(final_report, depth)
    
    if not validation_result.passed:
        # Trigger refinement
        final_report = await refine_report(final_report, validation_result.issues)
```
