## 💰 Cost Optimization Guide

### Cost Breakdown

**Typical API Costs** (GPT-4):
- Input: $0.03 per 1K tokens
- Output: $0.06 per 1K tokens

**Tavily Search**:
- $1 per 1,000 searches (Free tier: 1,000/month)

### Pattern Cost Comparison

| Pattern | Avg Tokens | Searches | Estimated Cost |
|---------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Basic Sequential | 3,000 | 1 | $0.10 |
| Concurrent (3 searches) | 5,000 | 3 | $0.25 |
| Self-Improving (3 iterations) | 8,000 | 3 | $0.45 |
| Multi-Perspective (4 experts) | 12,000 | 3 | $0.70 |
| Hierarchical (depth 2) | 10,000 | 5 | $0.60 |
| Evidence-Based | 9,000 | 3 | $0.50 |

### Cost Reduction Strategies

#### 1. Use Caching
```python
# Save 50-70% on repeated queries
cache = SearchCache()
result = await cache.search_with_cache(query)
```

#### 2. Limit Search Depth
```python
# Use basic instead of advanced for non-critical searches
search_results = tavily.search(
    query=query,
    search_depth="basic",  # vs "advanced"
    max_results=3  # vs 5-10
)
```

#### 3. Optimize Prompts
```python
# Shorter, more focused prompts
instructions = "Summarize in 2 paragraphs"  # vs lengthy instructions
```

#### 4. Use Smaller Models for Simple Tasks
```python
# GPT-3.5 for simple tasks (10x cheaper)
planner = create_agent(model="gpt-35-turbo")  # Simple planning
writer = create_agent(model="gpt-4o")  # Complex synthesis
```

## ⏱ Time Optimization Guide

### Execution Time Breakdown

**Basic Sequential** (30-45s):
- Planning: 5-8s
- Research: 10-15s
- Writing: 10-15s
- Review: 5-7s

**Concurrent Search** (20-30s):
- Planning: 5-8s
- Parallel Search: 5-10s (3x faster!)
- Writing: 8-10s
- Review: 5-7s

### Speed Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Parallel Execution
```python
# Run independent tasks concurrently
results = await asyncio.gather(
    search1, search2, search3  # Parallel!
)
```

#### 2. Streaming
```python
# Start processing before all data arrives
async for chunk in workflow.run_stream(objective):
    process_chunk(chunk)  # Process incrementally
```

#### 3. Caching
```python
# Return cached results instantly
if query in cache:
    return cache[query]  # 0ms vs 10s
```

#### 4. Timeout Settings
```python
# Don't wait forever for slow searches
search_results = tavily.search(query, timeout=10)
```
