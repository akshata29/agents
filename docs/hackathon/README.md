# Hackathon Curriculum

## Overview

This curriculum helps teams ramp on the Microsoft Agent Framework (MAF) portfolio that ships with this repository. It replaces the retired “Foundation Framework” material with up-to-date guidance focused on the apps you have just refreshed—Deep Research, FinAgent Dynamic, FinAgent, Advisor Productivity, Multimodal Insights, and the Patterns Sandbox.
