# Agent Output Viewing - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Interactive Agent Tabs**
The agent banner at the top (Company, SEC, Earnings, Fundamentals, Technicals, Report) is now **fully interactive** with:
- ✅ **Status indicators** - Each tab shows the agent's execution status with colored icons:
  - Green checkmark (✓) = Completed
  - Blue spinner = Running  
  - Red X = Failed
  - Gray circle = Pending/Not started
- ✅ **Clickable tabs** - Click on any completed agent to view its detailed output
- ✅ **Hover effects** - Visual feedback when hovering over clickable agents

### 2. **Agent Detail View**
When you click on an agent tab or execution step, you get a dedicated view showing:

#### **Agent Header**
- Agent name and description
- Status badge (Completed/Failed/Running)
- Execution duration

#### **Analysis Output** 
- Full text output from the agent
- Formatted in a scrollable code block
- Timestamp showing when it was generated

#### **Generated Artifacts**
- Any artifacts created by that specific agent
- Displayed with title and type
- Full content visible

#### **Error Display**
- If the agent failed, the error message is prominently displayed

#### **Back Navigation**
- "Back to Timeline" button to return to the main view

### 3. **Enhanced Execution Steps**
The execution timeline now has:
- ✅ **Clickable step cards** - Click any completed step to view details
- ✅ **Hover effects** - Visual indication that steps are clickable
- ✅ **Chevron indicators** - Shows clickable steps with a right arrow
- ✅ **Status icons** - Visual status for each step

## How to Use

### **View Individual Agent Output:**

1. **From Agent Banner (Top Tabs)**:
   - After a research execution completes
   - Click on any agent icon/name in the top banner
   - View that agent's detailed output

2. **From Execution Timeline**:
   - In the Execution Monitor tab
   - Click on any completed step card
   - View that agent's detailed analysis

3. **Navigate Back**:
   - Click "Back to Timeline" button
   - Returns to the main execution view

### **Visual Indicators:**

- **Green text/icons** = Agent completed successfully (clickable)
- **Blue text/icons** = Agent currently running
- **Red text/icons** = Agent failed with error
- **Gray icons** = Agent pending/not started

## Files Modified

1. **`ExecutionMonitor.tsx`** - Added agent detail view and click handlers
2. **`AgentBanner.tsx`** - New component for interactive agent tabs
3. **`App.tsx`** - Integrated agent selection state management
