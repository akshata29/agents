This is a comprehensive demo showcasing 5 different orchestration patterns using the Microsoft Agent Framework with a modern React + Vite + Tailwind CSS frontend.

## Architecture

- **Backend**: FastAPI with Microsoft Agent Framework integration
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript
- **Patterns**: Sequential, Concurrent, Group Chat, Handoff, Magentic

## Features

### üéØ Orchestration Patterns

1. **Sequential** - Structured workflow execution (Planner ‚Üí Researcher ‚Üí Writer ‚Üí Reviewer)
2. **Concurrent** - Parallel task processing with multiple agents working simultaneously
3. **Group Chat** - Collaborative decision-making with iterative agent conversations
4. **Handoff** - Intelligent task routing to specialized agents
5. **Magentic** - Strategic project management with goal-oriented coordination

## üìã Pattern Implementation Guide

### 1. Sequential Pattern - Detailed Implementation

The Sequential pattern is ideal for multi-step processes where each stage builds upon the previous one's output.

#### **When to Use Sequential Pattern:**
- ‚úÖ Processes made up of multiple steps that must happen in a specific order, where each step relies on the one before it
- ‚úÖ Data workflows where each stage adds something important that the next stage needs to work properly
- ‚úÖ Tasks where stages can't be done at the same time and must run one after another
- ‚úÖ Situations that require gradual improvements, like drafting, reviewing, and polishing content
- ‚úÖ Systems where you know how each agent performs and can handle delays or failures in any step without stopping the whole process

#### **Avoid Sequential Pattern When:**
- ‚ùå Stages can be run independently and in parallel without affecting quality
- ‚ùå A single agent can perform the entire task effectively
- ‚ùå Early stages may fail or produce poor output, and there's no way to stop or correct downstream processing based on errors
- ‚ùå Agents need to collaborate dynamically rather than hand off work sequentially
- ‚ùå The workflow requires iteration, backtracking, or dynamic routing based on intermediate results

#### **Implementation Steps:**

```python
from agent_framework import SequentialBuilder, WorkflowOutputEvent, ChatMessage
from common.agents import AgentFactory

async def run_sequential_orchestration(task: str) -> list:
    """
    Demonstrates sequential orchestration following Microsoft Agent Framework best practices.
    
    This implementation follows the documented 6-step process:
    1. Create chat client (via AgentFactory)
    2. Define specialized agents
    3. Build sequential workflow
    4. Run the workflow
    5. Process workflow events
    6. Extract final conversation
    """
    
    # Step 1: Create your chat client (handled by AgentFactory)
    # AgentFactory sets up AzureOpenAIChatClient with proper credentials
    factory = AgentFactory()
    
    # Step 2: Define your agents
    # Each agent has specific instructions and expertise areas
    planner = factory.create_planner_agent()      # Task decomposition and strategy
    researcher = factory.create_researcher_agent()  # Information gathering and analysis
    writer = factory.create_writer_agent()        # Content creation and synthesis
    reviewer = factory.create_reviewer_agent()    # Quality assurance and feedback
    
    # Step 3: Build the sequential workflow
    # Use SequentialBuilder to ensure proper order execution
    workflow = SequentialBuilder().participants([
        planner,    # üéØ Strategic planning and task breakdown
        researcher, # üîç Information gathering and analysis  
        writer,     # ‚úçÔ∏è  Content creation and synthesis
        reviewer    # ‚úÖ Quality assurance and feedback
    ]).build()
    
    # Step 4: Run the workflow
    # Call run_stream method to execute the sequential process
    conversation_outputs = []
    
    # Step 5: Process the workflow events
    # Iterate through WorkflowOutputEvent instances for results
    async for event in workflow.run_stream(task):
        if isinstance(event, WorkflowOutputEvent):
            conversation_outputs.append(cast(list[ChatMessage], event.data))
    
    # Step 6: Extract the final conversation
    # Collect complete conversation history showing each agent's contribution
    if conversation_outputs:
        final_conversation = conversation_outputs[-1]
        return [
            {
                "agent": message.author_name or ("user" if message.role.value == "user" else "assistant"),
                "input": task if i == 0 else "Output from previous agent",
                "output": message.text,
                "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
            }
            for i, message in enumerate(final_conversation)
        ]
    
    return []
```

- Aggregates diverse perspectives (e.g., Summarizer, ProsCons, RiskAssessor) 
- Reduces overall runtime through true parallel execution
- Ideal for brainstorming, voting/consensus, and specialized skill combination

### Group Chat Orchestration
**When to use**: Collaborative problem-solving, iterative maker-checker loops, consensus building
- Managed conversation with turn-taking (Writer ‚ü∑ Reviewer ‚ü∑ Moderator) 
- Supports human-in-the-loop interactions and real-time oversight
- Transparent conversations with quality gates and approval processes
- Ideal for creative brainstorming and cross-disciplinary dialogue

### Handoff Orchestration
**When to use**: Dynamic routing, specialized expertise, customer support scenarios, content-based delegation
- Intelligent routing based on request analysis and emerging expertise requirements
- Full ownership transfer to appropriate specialist agents
- Guard conditions and fallback mechanisms for robust routing decisions
- Ideal when agent selection can't be predetermined but emerges from content analysis

### Magentic Orchestration

## Sequential Pattern Implementation Details

Our Sequential pattern implementation validates against the documented framework guidelines and follows the established best practices exactly:

### ‚úÖ **Six-Step Implementation Process**
```python
# STEP 1: Create chat client (via AgentFactory)
factory = AgentFactory()

# STEP 2: Define your agents  
planner = factory.create_planner_agent()
researcher = factory.create_researcher_agent()
writer = factory.create_writer_agent() 
reviewer = factory.create_reviewer_agent()

# STEP 3: Define the conversation sequence
# STEP 4: Add agents in execution order
workflow = SequentialBuilder().participants([
    planner,    # 1Ô∏è‚É£ Strategic analysis & task breakdown
    researcher, # 2Ô∏è‚É£ Information gathering using planner's insights  
    writer,     # 3Ô∏è‚É£ Content creation with research context
    reviewer    # 4Ô∏è‚É£ Quality review of the complete workflow
]).build()

# STEP 5: Build the orchestrator
# STEP 6: Execute the workflow
async for event in workflow.run_stream(task):
    if isinstance(event, WorkflowOutputEvent):
        conversation_outputs.append(cast(list[ChatMessage], event.data))
```

### When to Use Sequential Pattern
‚úÖ **Ideal for:**
- Strategic planning that requires step-by-step analysis
- Content creation pipelines with quality gates  
- Processes requiring progressive refinement
- Tasks where order and context accumulation matter
- Business workflows with clear handoff points

‚ùå **Avoid for:**
- Tasks requiring real-time collaboration
- Independent parallel analyses
- Dynamic routing based on content
- Simple single-agent tasks

### Real-World Examples
- **Strategic Planning**: "Develop a go-to-market strategy for AI-powered healthcare diagnostics"
- **Process Design**: "Design a customer onboarding process for SaaS platform"  
- **Content Strategy**: "Create a comprehensive social media strategy for B2B fintech startup"
- **Risk Assessment**: "Analyze cybersecurity risks for remote work implementation"
- **Competitive Analysis**: "Research and compare top 5 project management tools for enterprise"

### Key Architecture Decisions
- **Conversation Accumulation**: Each agent receives full conversation history from predecessors
- **Role Specialization**: Agents have distinct capabilities tailored to their workflow stage
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception management and graceful degradation
- **Event Streaming**: Real-time progress monitoring with WorkflowOutputEvent handling
- **Output Structure**: Standardized conversation format for frontend integration

### Implementation Validation
‚úÖ Uses `SequentialBuilder().participants([...]).build()` pattern as documented  
‚úÖ Implements proper async execution with `workflow.run_stream(task)`  
‚úÖ Handles `WorkflowOutputEvent` types for conversation data extraction  
‚úÖ Follows established agent creation patterns via `AgentFactory`  
‚úÖ Maintains conversation context through `ChatMessage` objects

## Concurrent Pattern Implementation Details

Our Concurrent pattern implementation validates against the documented framework guidelines and follows the established best practices exactly:

### ‚úÖ **Six-Step Implementation Process**
```python
# STEP 1: Create your chat client (via AgentFactory)
factory = AgentFactory()

# STEP 2: Define your agents
summarizer = factory.create_summarizer_agent()     # Key insights and overview
pros_cons = factory.create_pros_cons_agent()       # Balanced advantage/disadvantage analysis
risk_assessor = factory.create_risk_assessor_agent() # Risk identification and mitigation

# STEP 3: Build the concurrent workflow
# Use ConcurrentBuilder to run multiple agents in parallel
workflow = ConcurrentBuilder().participants([
    summarizer,    # üìä Executive summary and key insights
    pros_cons,     # ‚öñÔ∏è  Balanced pros/cons analysis
    risk_assessor  # üö® Risk assessment and mitigation
]).build()

# STEP 4: Run the workflow
# All agents execute concurrently and return aggregated events
async for event in workflow.run_stream(task):
    if isinstance(event, WorkflowOutputEvent):
        outputs.append(cast(list[ChatMessage], event.data))

# STEP 5: Process the results
# Extract outputs from workflow events using aggregated conversations
aggregated_messages = outputs[0] if outputs else []

# STEP 6: Handle the aggregated responses
# Process messages from all agents with author identification
for message in aggregated_messages:
    agent_name = message.author_name or "assistant"
    agent_responses[agent_name].append(message.text)
```

### When to Use Concurrent Pattern
‚úÖ **Ideal for:**
- Tasks that can run at the same time using fixed group or dynamic agent selection
- Problems benefiting from different specialized skills (technical, business, creative) working independently
- Multi-agent decision-making: brainstorming ideas, ensemble reasoning, voting/consensus
- Scenarios where speed matters and parallel execution reduces wait time
- Independent analyses that don't require sequential dependencies

‚ùå **Avoid when:**
- Agents need to build on each other's work or depend on shared context in specific order
- Task requires strict sequence of steps or predictable, repeatable results
- Resource limits (like model usage quotas) make parallel execution inefficient or impossible
- Agents can't reliably coordinate changes to shared data/external systems while running simultaneously
- No clear way to resolve conflicts or contradictions between results from different agents
- Combining results is too complicated or ends up lowering overall quality

### Real-World Examples
Our implementation includes these practical scenarios:

1. **Strategic Decision Analysis** üéØ
   - *Task*: "Evaluate feasibility of 4-day work week policy for 200-employee tech company"
   - *Parallel Analysis*: Executive summary ‚ü∫ Pros/cons evaluation ‚ü∫ Risk assessment

2. **Investment Due Diligence** üí∞
   - *Task*: "Assess $2M Series A investment opportunity in fintech startup"
   - *Parallel Analysis*: Market research ‚ü∫ Financial analysis ‚ü∫ Competitive assessment

3. **Product Launch Planning** üöÄ
   - *Task*: "Evaluate go-to-market strategy for AI-powered healthcare diagnostics"
   - *Parallel Analysis*: Market sizing ‚ü∫ Regulatory requirements ‚ü∫ Technical feasibility

4. **Crisis Response Planning** üö®
   - *Task*: "Develop cybersecurity incident response for data breach affecting 50K customers"
   - *Parallel Analysis*: Technical remediation ‚ü∫ Legal compliance ‚ü∫ Communication strategy

5. **Technology Assessment** üî¨
   - *Task*: "Compare cloud migration strategies for legacy ERP system"
   - *Parallel Analysis*: Cost analysis ‚ü∫ Risk evaluation ‚ü∫ Implementation timeline

### Key Architecture Decisions
- **Independent Execution**: Each agent works autonomously without dependencies on other agents' outputs
- **Specialized Perspectives**: Agents provide distinct viewpoints (summary, pros/cons, risks) for comprehensive analysis
- **Parallel Processing**: True concurrent execution reduces overall processing time
- **Result Aggregation**: ConcurrentBuilder automatically combines all agent outputs into unified conversation
- **Conflict Resolution**: Frontend displays all perspectives allowing users to synthesize insights

### Implementation Validation
‚úÖ Uses `ConcurrentBuilder().participants([...]).build()` pattern as documented  
‚úÖ Implements proper async execution with `workflow.run_stream(task)`  
‚úÖ Handles `WorkflowOutputEvent` types for conversation data extraction  
‚úÖ Follows established agent creation patterns via `AgentFactory`  
‚úÖ Processes aggregated responses with proper author identification
‚úÖ Maintains independent agent execution without cross-dependencies

## Group Chat Pattern Implementation Details

Our Group Chat pattern implementation validates against the documented framework guidelines and follows the established best practices exactly:

### ‚úÖ **Six-Step Implementation Process**
```python
# STEP 1: Create your chat client (via AgentFactory)
factory = AgentFactory()

# STEP 2: Define your agents
writer = factory.create_writer_agent()       # Content creation and iteration
reviewer = factory.create_reviewer_agent()   # Quality evaluation and feedback  
moderator = factory.create_moderator_agent() # Decision making and conversation management

# STEP 3: Build the group chat workflow
# Use custom GroupChatManager with WorkflowBuilder for iterative conversations
manager = GroupChatManager(factory, max_iterations=4)
workflow = WorkflowBuilder().set_start_executor(manager).build()

# STEP 4: Run the workflow
# Manages iterative conversation with maker-checker loops
async for event in workflow.run_stream(task):
    if isinstance(event, WorkflowOutputEvent):
        outputs.append(event.data)

# STEP 5: Process the results
# Extract complete conversation thread from all participants
final_conversation = outputs[0] if outputs else []

# STEP 6: Handle the aggregated responses  
# Process conversation messages with participant identification and turn tracking
for message in final_conversation:
    agent_name = message.author_name or "user"
    conversation_data.append({"agent": agent_name, "output": message.text})
```

### When to Use Group Chat Pattern
‚úÖ **Ideal for:**
- Spontaneous or guided collaboration among agents (and possibly humans)
- Iterative maker-checker loops where agents take turns creating and reviewing
- Real-time human oversight or participation scenarios
- Transparent and auditable conversations since all output collected in single thread
- Creative brainstorming where agents build on each other's ideas
- Decision-making that benefits from debate and consensus building
- Complex problems requiring cross-disciplinary dialogue
- Quality control and validation requiring multiple expert perspectives
- Content workflows with clear separation between creation and review

‚ùå **Avoid when:**
- Simple task delegation or straightforward linear pipelines suffice
- Real-time speed requirements make discussion overhead impractical  
- Hierarchical or deterministic workflows are needed without discussion
- The chat manager can't clearly determine when the task is complete
- Managing conversation flow becomes too complex, especially with many agents (limit to three or fewer for easier control)

### Real-World Examples
Our implementation includes these practical scenarios:

1. **Content Strategy Development** üìù
   - *Task*: "Create compelling marketing strategy for AI-powered personal finance app"
   - *Flow*: Writer creates strategy ‚Üí Reviewer evaluates ‚Üí Moderator decides ‚Üí Iterate until consensus

2. **Product Requirements Definition** üéØ
   - *Task*: "Define technical requirements for blockchain-based supply chain tracking"
   - *Flow*: Technical writer drafts ‚Üí Business reviewer validates ‚Üí Product moderator approves

3. **Policy Development Process** üìã  
   - *Task*: "Develop remote work policy for 500-employee consulting firm"
   - *Flow*: Policy writer creates draft ‚Üí Legal reviewer checks compliance ‚Üí HR moderator finalizes

4. **Research Paper Collaboration** üî¨
   - *Task*: "Draft research proposal for AI ethics in healthcare applications"
   - *Flow*: Researcher writes sections ‚Üí Peer reviewer provides feedback ‚Üí Senior moderator guides direction

5. **Crisis Communication Planning** üö®
   - *Task*: "Create crisis communication plan for data security breach"
   - *Flow*: Communications writer drafts ‚Üí Legal reviewer ensures compliance ‚Üí Executive moderator approves

### Key Architecture Decisions
- **Iterative Conversation Management**: Custom GroupChatManager coordinates turn-taking between participants
- **Maker-Checker Loops**: Writer creates, Reviewer evaluates, Moderator decides on next steps
- **Termination Logic**: Smart decision-making for when conversation reaches satisfactory conclusion
- **Human-in-the-Loop Ready**: Architecture supports real-time human participation and oversight
- **Conversation Continuity**: Complete conversation thread maintained for transparency and auditability

### Group Chat Customization Options
Based on your hackathon guidelines, the pattern supports:

- **Conversation Filtering**: How results are summarized or processed at conclusion
- **Agent Selection Logic**: How the next agent is chosen in the conversation flow  
- **User Input Integration**: When to request human input during the conversation
- **Termination Criteria**: When to conclude the conversation (max rounds, consensus, etc.)

### Group Chat Call Order
The implementation follows the documented call sequence:
1. **should_request_user_input**: Checks if human input needed before next agent responds
2. **should_terminate**: Determines if conversation should end (max rounds reached, consensus achieved)  
3. **filter_results**: If ending, summarizes or processes the final conversation
4. **select_next_agent**: If continuing, chooses the next agent to speak

### Implementation Validation
‚úÖ Uses `WorkflowBuilder().set_start_executor()` pattern with custom executor as documented  
‚úÖ Implements iterative conversation management with proper turn-taking

## Handoff Pattern Implementation Details

Our Handoff pattern implementation validates against the documented framework guidelines and follows the established best practices exactly:

### ‚úÖ **Four-Step Implementation Process**
```python
# STEP 1: Set up data models and chat client
factory = AgentFactory()  # Chat client setup via AgentFactory
# Define routing data structures and configure agents for structured responses

# STEP 2: Create specialized executor functions
class HandoffManager(Executor):
    # Input storage - saves incoming data and forwards to classification
    # Transformation - converts routing decisions into typed objects
    # Handler executors - separate processing for each specialist type

# STEP 3: Build routing logic  
def analyze_and_route_request():
    # Factory functions for condition checkers
    # Conditions examine messages and route based on classification
    # Switch-case logic with Default fallback for unexpected scenarios

# STEP 4: Assemble the workflow
workflow = WorkflowBuilder().set_start_executor(manager).build()
# Connect executors with edges, add switch-case routing
# Configure first-match or fallback-to-default behavior
```

### When to Use Handoff Pattern
‚úÖ **Ideal for:**
- Tasks needing specialized knowledge or tools, but agent number/order can't be determined in advance
- Expertise requirements emerging dynamically during processing, triggering content-based routing
- Multiple-domain problems requiring different specialists working sequentially  
- Clear signals or rules exist indicating when agents should transfer control and to whom
- Customer service scenarios with request categorization and specialist routing
- Dynamic delegation based on request analysis and contextual needs

‚ùå **Avoid when:**
- The involved agents and their order are known upfront and fixed
- Task routing is simple and rule-based, not needing dynamic interpretation
- Poor routing decisions might frustrate users or create confusion
- Multiple operations must run at the same time (use Concurrent instead)
- Avoiding infinite handoff loops or excessive bouncing between agents is difficult

### Real-World Examples  
Our implementation includes these practical scenarios:

1. **Customer Service Ticketing** üé´
   - *Task*: "I ordered a laptop but haven't received shipping confirmation after 3 days"
   - *Flow*: Router analyzes request ‚Üí Routes to Status Agent ‚Üí Provides order tracking assistance

2. **Technical Support Routing** üîß
   - *Task*: "My smart device won't connect to WiFi despite following setup instructions"  
   - *Flow*: Router identifies technical issue ‚Üí Routes to Support Agent ‚Üí Provides troubleshooting guidance

3. **Returns and Refunds Processing** üì¶
   - *Task*: "My order arrived damaged and I need to return it for a full refund"
   - *Flow*: Router detects return request ‚Üí Routes to Returns Agent ‚Üí Initiates return process

4. **Healthcare Triage System** üè•
   - *Task*: "I have severe chest pain and difficulty breathing"
   - *Flow*: Triage router assesses urgency ‚Üí Routes to Emergency Specialist ‚Üí Provides immediate guidance

5. **Financial Services Routing** üí≥
   - *Task*: "Someone used my credit card fraudulently, I need to dispute charges"
   - *Flow*: Router identifies fraud case ‚Üí Routes to Fraud Specialist ‚Üí Initiates dispute process

### Key Architecture Decisions
- **Dynamic Routing Logic**: Router agent analyzes request content and makes intelligent routing decisions
- **Specialist Agent Mapping**: Clean mapping between routing decisions and specialized agent capabilities
- **Ownership Transfer**: Complete handoff of conversation context to selected specialist  
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Default routing for ambiguous or unexpected request types
- **Guard Conditions**: Verification of correct message processing at each routing step
- **Conversation Continuity**: Maintains complete conversation thread through handoff process

### Hybrid Implementation Approach
Our implementation uses a **hybrid approach** that combines the reliability of structured routing with the simplicity of straightforward architecture:

#### ‚úÖ **Structured Routing Benefits**:
- **Pydantic Data Models**: `RoutingDecision` with validation for specialist, confidence, and reasoning  
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time guarantees about routing data structure and validation
- **Confidence Scoring**: Router provides confidence levels (0.0-1.0) for routing decisions
- **Reasoning Transparency**: Clear explanations for why specific specialists were selected
- **JSON Validation**: Structured responses with automatic error detection

#### ‚úÖ **Simple Architecture Benefits**:
- **Single Executor**: HandoffManager coordinates everything without complex executor chains
- **Graceful Fallback**: Automatic text parsing when JSON fails, ensuring robustness
- **Easy Debugging**: Clear conversation flow with detailed routing information
- **Quick Modifications**: Simple to add new specialists or change routing logic

#### ‚úÖ **Production-Ready Features**:
- **Error Handling**: Multiple fallback layers for reliable operation
- **Guard Conditions**: Pydantic validation ensures data integrity
- **Monitoring Ready**: Routing decisions include confidence and reasoning for observability

### Handoff Routing Architecture
The implementation supports the documented routing flow:
1. **Input Storage**: Saves incoming request data to shared workflow state
2. **Classification**: Router agent analyzes content and determines appropriate specialist
3. **Transformation**: Converts routing decision into actionable specialist selection  
4. **Condition Checking**: Validates routing decision and applies guard conditions
5. **Handler Execution**: Transfers control to selected specialist agent
6. **Output Generation**: Specialist provides expert response and concludes workflow

### Structured Routing Example
```json
{
  "specialist": "status", 
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "reasoning": "Customer is asking about order tracking and delivery timeline"
}
```

The router agent returns structured JSON that gets validated against our Pydantic model:
- **Type Safety**: Only valid specialist types ("status", "returns", "support") accepted
- **Confidence Range**: Validates 0.0-1.0 range for decision confidence  
- **Reasoning Required**: Ensures transparent decision-making process
- **Automatic Fallback**: If JSON parsing fails, falls back to text-based routing

## Magentic Pattern Implementation Details

Our Magentic pattern implementation validates against the documented framework guidelines and follows the established best practices exactly:

### ‚úÖ **Seven-Step Implementation Process**
```python
# STEP 1: Define specialized agents
planner = factory.create_planner_agent()      # Strategic planning and task decomposition
researcher = factory.create_researcher_agent()  # Information gathering with tools
writer = factory.create_writer_agent()       # Content synthesis and documentation  
validator = factory.create_validator_agent() # Quality assurance and final approval

# STEP 2: Set up event handling callback
async def on_event(event):
    # Handle orchestrator messages, agent streaming updates, agent messages, final results
    if isinstance(event, MagenticAgentMessageEvent):
        print(f"Agent {event.agent_id}: {event.message.text}")

# STEP 3: Build the Magentic workflow
workflow = MagenticBuilder().participants(
    planner=planner, researcher=researcher, writer=writer, validator=validator
).on_event(on_event, mode=MagenticCallbackMode.STREAMING)

# STEP 4: Configure the standard manager
workflow.with_standard_manager(
    chat_client=factory.chat_client,
    max_round_count=10,     # Maximum collaboration rounds
    max_stall_count=3,      # Stall detection limits
    max_reset_count=2       # Reset behavior control
).build()

# STEP 5: Run the workflow
async for event in workflow.run_stream(complex_task):
    # Workflow dynamically plans, delegates, and coordinates collaboration

# STEP 6: Process workflow events  
# Handle MagenticAgentMessageEvent, MagenticOrchestratorMessageEvent, MagenticFinalResultEvent

# STEP 7: Extract the final result
# Collect complete solution developed through collaborative agent effort
```

### When to Use Magentic Pattern
‚úÖ **Ideal for:**
- Complex or open-ended problems with no predetermined solution path
- Input and feedback from multiple specialized agents needed to shape valid solutions
- System must generate documented plan of approach for human review
- Agents have tools that directly interact with external systems and resources  
- Step-by-step, dynamically built execution plan adds value before running tasks
- Project management and goal-oriented coordination scenarios
- Tasks requiring planning, research, creation, and validation phases

‚ùå **Avoid when:**
- The solution path is fixed or deterministic
- There's no need to produce a ledger or plan of approach
- Task is simple enough for more lightweight orchestration patterns
- Speed is the priority (this method emphasizes planning over fast execution)
- You expect frequent stalls or loops without clear resolution path
