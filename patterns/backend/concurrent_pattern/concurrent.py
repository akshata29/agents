"""
Concurrent Orchestration Pattern using Microsoft Agent Framework

This pattern demonstrates concurrent agent orchestration following the documented
best practices for parallel multi-agent execution. Multiple specialized agents
work independently on the same task, providing diverse perspectives that are
aggregated into a comprehensive analysis.

Pattern Architecture: Summarizer ‚ü∫ ProsCons ‚ü∫ RiskAssessor (parallel execution)

Key Characteristics:
- Agents execute simultaneously without dependencies
- Each agent provides specialized analysis (summary, pros/cons, risk assessment)  
- Results are automatically aggregated by ConcurrentBuilder
- Ideal for multi-perspective decision-making and ensemble reasoning
- Reduces overall processing time through true parallel execution

Implementation follows the documented 6-step process:
1. Create chat client (via AgentFactory)
2. Define specialized agents with distinct expertise areas
3. Build concurrent workflow using ConcurrentBuilder
4. Run workflow with parallel agent execution
5. Process aggregated results from all agents
6. Handle combined responses with author identification

Uses ConcurrentBuilder from the official Microsoft Agent Framework.

    Demonstrates concurrent orchestration following Microsoft Agent Framework best practices.
    
    This implementation follows the documented 6-step concurrent pattern process:
    1. Create chat client (via AgentFactory) 
    2. Define specialized agents with distinct analysis capabilities
    3. Build concurrent workflow using ConcurrentBuilder class
    4. Run workflow - all agents execute in parallel
    5. Process results - extract outputs from aggregated conversations  
    6. Handle aggregated responses - process messages with author identification
    
    The concurrent pattern is ideal for:
    - Tasks benefiting from multiple specialized perspectives
    - Independent analyses that can run simultaneously
    - Ensemble decision-making and multi-agent brainstorming
    - Scenarios where speed matters and parallel execution reduces wait time
    
    Args:
        task (str, optional): The business task to analyze through concurrent agents.
                            If None, uses a default workplace policy evaluation scenario.
    
    Returns:
        list: Formatted responses from all agents containing:
              [
                {
                  "agent": str,        # Agent name (Summarizer, ProsCons, RiskAssessor)
                  "input": str,        # Original task input
                  "output": str,       # Agent's analysis output
                  "timestamp": str     # ISO timestamp of completion
                }
              ]
    
    Raises:
        Exception: If Azure OpenAI client initialization fails
        Exception: If workflow execution encounters unrecoverable errors
        
    Example:
        >>> task = "Evaluate implementing 4-day work week for tech company"
        >>> results = await run_concurrent_orchestration(task)
        >>> print(f"Concurrent analysis completed with {len(results)} agent perspectives")
        
    Note:
        This implementation ensures true parallel execution where agents work
        independently and results are aggregated, following documented concurrent
        orchestration best practices exactly.
