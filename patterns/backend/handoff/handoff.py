Handoff Orchestration Pattern using Microsoft Agent Framework

This pattern demonstrates handoff orchestration following the documented
best practices for dynamic agent delegation and specialized routing. Agents
can intelligently transfer control to specialized peers based on content
analysis and expertise requirements that emerge during processing.

Pattern Architecture: Router ‚Üí Dynamic Specialist Selection (Status, Returns, Support)

Key Characteristics:
- Tasks requiring specialized knowledge where agent selection can't be predetermined
- Dynamic routing based on content analysis and emerging expertise requirements  
- Multiple-domain problems requiring different specialists working sequentially
- Clear ownership transfer signals and rules for when agents should delegate control
- Guard conditions and fallback mechanisms for robust routing decisions

Implementation follows the documented 4-step process:
1. Set up data models and chat client (AgentFactory with structured responses)
2. Create specialized executor functions (input storage, transformation, handlers)
3. Build routing logic (condition checkers, switch-case patterns, default fallbacks)
4. Assemble workflow (WorkflowBuilder with routing edges and terminal executors)

Hybrid Implementation Approach:
- Pydantic models for structured JSON responses with validation (RoutingDecision, HandoffRequest)
- Type-safe routing decisions with confidence scoring and reasoning
- Robust fallback parsing for cases where structured JSON fails
- Simple architecture maintained while gaining reliability benefits
- Guard conditions through Pydantic validation and error handling
- Production-ready error handling with graceful degradation

This hybrid approach provides 80% of complex routing benefits with 20% of the implementation complexity,
making it perfect for both demonstration and production use cases.

Uses WorkflowBuilder with custom executor from the official Microsoft Agent Framework.
