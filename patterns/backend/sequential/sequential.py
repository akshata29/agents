Sequential Orchestration Pattern - Microsoft Agent Framework Implementation

OVERVIEW:
This module implements the Sequential orchestration pattern following Microsoft Agent Framework
best practices. The pattern executes agents in a defined order where each agent builds upon
the previous agent's output, creating a structured workflow for complex tasks.

PATTERN FLOW:
Planner ‚Üí Researcher ‚Üí Writer ‚Üí Reviewer

WHEN TO USE:
‚úÖ Multi-step processes requiring specific execution order
‚úÖ Data workflows where each stage adds critical information
‚úÖ Tasks requiring gradual refinement (drafting ‚Üí reviewing ‚Üí polishing)
‚úÖ Known agent performance with predictable failure handling

AVOID WHEN:
‚ùå Stages can run independently in parallel
‚ùå Single agent can handle entire task effectively
‚ùå Need dynamic collaboration or iteration
‚ùå Early failures can't be corrected downstream

IMPLEMENTATION VALIDATION:
This implementation follows the documented 6-step process:
1. ‚úÖ Create chat client (via AgentFactory with Azure OpenAI)
2. ‚úÖ Define specialized agents with specific roles
3. ‚úÖ Build sequential workflow using SequentialBuilder
4. ‚úÖ Execute via workflow.run_stream() method
5. ‚úÖ Process WorkflowOutputEvent instances correctly
6. ‚úÖ Extract and format final conversation history

REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS:
- Corporate training program development
- Software development lifecycle planning  
- Supply chain optimization projects
- Merger & acquisition integration planning

    Execute Sequential Orchestration Pattern following Microsoft Agent Framework best practices.
    
    This function implements the complete 6-step sequential orchestration process:
    1. Initialize Azure OpenAI chat client via AgentFactory
    2. Create specialized agents with defined roles and expertise
    3. Build sequential workflow ensuring proper execution order  
    4. Execute workflow using streaming for real-time progress
    5. Process WorkflowOutputEvent instances to capture results
    6. Extract and format final conversation for API consumption
    
    Args:
        task (str, optional): The business task to process through the sequential workflow.
                            If None, uses a default comprehensive business planning task.
    
    Returns:
        list: Formatted conversation history containing each agent's contribution:
              [
                {
                  "agent": str,        # Agent name (Planner, Researcher, Writer, Reviewer)
                  "input": str,        # Input received by this agent
                  "output": str,       # Agent's response/output
                  "timestamp": str     # ISO timestamp of agent execution
                }
              ]
    
    Raises:
        Exception: If Azure OpenAI client initialization fails
        Exception: If workflow execution encounters unrecoverable errors
        
    Example:
        >>> task = "Develop a digital transformation strategy for manufacturing"
        >>> results = await run_sequential_orchestration(task)
        >>> print(f"Sequential workflow completed with {len(results)} agent contributions")
        
    Note:
        This implementation ensures each agent builds upon the previous agent's output,
        creating a coherent and progressively refined result that follows the documented
        sequential pattern best practices.
